We started out the session in a mortuary. All of us slowly woke up and checked our surroundings. Alindor noticed Q that looked odd compared to everyone else. Q was a sort of soft and gooey mix that was moving around as if his skin was crawling. Alindor decided to walk up and poke Q. With a bit of a harder poke, Alindor felt the skin start to collapse inwards. Alindor quickly pulls his hand away, noticing that even though Q looked gooey, he was dry. Alindor also noticed that the spot he pushed on did not fully smooth out. His imprint remained. While M.J. was walking around talking with others, Alindor told M.J. that Q was soft and M.J. decided to go over and hug Q. Q was able to slightly hug back during this although he did not have full functionality. M.J. noticed that Q felt cold like metal. After a bit of getting to know each other and trying to figure out who we are and why we are where we are, we decided to move out of this room. We opened up a door to the south and it had some others in there but Pinto quickly closed the door. 

We ended the session here because of some technical difficulties. I also missed some info because i was trying to sort out some stuff on my character sheet.
