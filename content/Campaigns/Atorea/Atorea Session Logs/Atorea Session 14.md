Vulcan heads to a local stable to rent another horse to help us get to Tharum'zuun. Vulcan is able to purchase a Draft Horse for 50 gold. 
Amphor helped chip in 15 gold and a few others in the party chipped in as well. We start heading to Tharum'Zuun. As we are heading there, we hear a loud screech echo across the sky. Vulcan and Riley seem to somewhat recognize the sound (Wyverns).

As we continue forward we see one Wyvern land on a perch in front of us and another starts swooping at us from the side. The first one to swoop at us got taken out pretty quickly. Vulcan ran and jumped and Blaze teleported the two of them up to and Vulcan landed on his back. While grappling him, Vulcan and the Wyvern had a fight high up in the sky. At one point the Wyvern decided to try and dive down and swoop at Valis. Vulcan took his opportunity to get off here as he was low but we were able to kill the second Wyvern before he did much more damage. 

After the fight, we healed up a bit and spent some time harvesting the Wyverns for Stingers, Claws, Teeth, Hide, and Tongues. Unfortunately we did not get the stingers but we got everything else. We decided to keep moving for a few more hours before resting. 

As we rest, Oof uses up the Wyvern Tongue and some various things he foraged along our way. He spends some time cooking over the fire and eventually servers everyone an amazing meal (nat 20). 

As we long rest, Valis tried talking to Amphor about what he knows about the Wyrm's Eye. 



### Prep Action Items:
- Tom to sort out what Amphor would tell us about Wyrm's Eye
