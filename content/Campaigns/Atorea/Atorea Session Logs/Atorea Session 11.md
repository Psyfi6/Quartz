We got to a good spot down the road on where we decided to set up. Everyone but Vulcan grabbed one of the boom sticks and we split up on both sides of the ravine. Vulcan sat further ahead and casted bonfire as the wagon approached to slow them down and cause them to stop. While they stopped everyone set of their boom sticks to start collapsing the rocks down onto them. A bunch of rocks took out the wagon and one of the horse. As we approach the wagon we see a dragonborn with copper scales. Valis launched an arrow at the other dragonborns as he yells "you fucked us". The rest of us also began to fight against the dragonborns. Riley was able to knock one of them off a cliff, Vulcan and Lucius defended the wagon while holding off the remaining dragonborns. After finishing off the remaining dragonborns, we checked on the ones still within the wagon. One of them was hurt but still alive, the other one was the heir who we were originally trying to protect. Amphor was the remaining survivor.


Some important character development
- Vulcan realizing that not just the elites of the world can be evil and that even some people within the general public can be evil. This will really make him contemplate how he feels about things. Should a large portion of the world be "dealt with" even if it has large implications on society or should things be left as is because maybe my views on society are too drastic of a change.
- Lucius feels like he let down Damian, the things that might come from his actions could cause irreparable damage and potentially the lose of many lives.



META:
Tom said that people can change their starting feats. Many of us feel like things aren't really aligning with how we wanted them to.
