Talked with Amphor (gold dragonborn who was escorting the prince) about why we were here, what happened, who he is and who he's with, where he's going, and same for us. We claimed we were heading into the opposite direction as him and happened to come across the crashed cart. We were in the area looking for a lost item (the dragon ball from Vulcan's dream) although when questioned about what item we were looking for Vulcan claimed it was none of his business. He was hesitant to accept our help but doesn't really have any other option. After some insight/investigation checks we feel confident that this is the prince based on the story, vibe from Amphor, and the gear worn by them. 

Riley investigates the dead white-dragonborns, we found a letter that describes Valis, and to confirm the kill and cut any lose ends. It says they were sent by [[REDACTED INFO]]#1. (although this was only later translated by Vulcan). Riley pocketed this letter without Amphor seeing. Riley also fixes up the wagon so that we can try to bring the dead bodies back. During this, Lucius went down the road to see if he could find the horse that limped away. We healed up the horse and then started planning on what we were going to do. We gave Amphor a few blankets or other clothes to help cover things up and prevent questions if we come across anyone else. 

We decided to move the 4 white dragonborns up to one of the higher levels of the ravine and burn the bodies. Once done with our short rest and dealing with the bodies, we started heading into Udoprax. Vulcan used his wild shapes as much as possible to turn into a second horse and help pull the cart. Then taking a short rest to recharge and go again. 

Lucius and Valis had a nice talk together while on the first watch at our camp. Discussing how this happened and that Lucius shouldn't feel bad for the mistake Valis made in his communications around this. Riley and Amphor took second watch. Amphor asked some more questions as he was before hoping to get more answers. Such as where we are coming from, where we are going. Riley explained where she was going before her boat crashed into the Lost Island and the remaining captains/survivors decided to go to Wrayax. Amphor suggests that the emperor will likely react to this assassination with a war. Riley suggests that we will reconsider what is the plan once we get to Udoprax. Amphor likely could find resources and supplies and help in town and no longer need us. Vulcan and Oof take the 3rd watch. Vulcan asks Oof about how hes doing without his donkey. Oof mentions hes a bit sad and misses his donkey. Vulcan uses find familiar to summon a cat and has the cat hang out with oof and keep him company. Oof gets a tear in his eye at the gesture. 

After our night watch we continue on with our travel. It is an uneventful day and as night approaches are on the outskirts of Udoprax. 


### PARTY ACTION ITEMS:
- Figure out if we want to break off at Udoprax or stick with this guy and escort him to Tharum'zuun.
	- If splitting, where are we going to go?
