Between sessions we spent a few weeks fixing up the ship and setting sail to Wrayax on Drakanguard. One of the nights on the ship Vulcan was visited in his dream again by the woman who had warned him about the gems. She said that there was one on the ship right now in someone's possession. Vulcan spent a day or two speaking with everyone on the ship. He would try to approach people in private and talk. Mentioning why he is here and where he is going and if they have seen or potentially have the red gem. He is suspicious of the other 2 dragon born as well as a few others, including Valis. Lucius was very willing to help and so was Riley. She casted detect magic to help find this item. The detect magic spell made it clear that there was a few glowing items. Multiple on Lucius and one on Valis. The one on Lucius was pretty small though while the one on Valis seemed to be about the right size. Vulcan, Riley, and Lucius approached Valis to further ask about the gem. Valis continued to deny having it but then Riley mentioned that she knew he had it because of casting detect magic. After some discussion between Riley and Valis, Riley decided to cast identify on the gem. It did not give much detail other than it appears to be some type of "key" that can open/unseal/summon something. Valis decided to head over to Vulcan and give him the gem and explain why he was hesitant about giving it up at first if it was as dangerous as described. We decided to put the gem into our bag of holding to protect it. Vulcan decided to give Riley his gold for helping him sort this out. He explained that he doesn't care for gold and other material possessions. She decided to give him the 4 Girallon tusks that she had harvested before we left. As we continue sailing, Vulcan would have asked Riley about his dreams and how something like that could work. We finish the session landing at the Wrayax port.
