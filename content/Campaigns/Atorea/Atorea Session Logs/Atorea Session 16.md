As a party we discuss if we should ask around about the stones Vulcan is having dreams about. Vulcan mentions that if these stones are spread out across the world its possible they used to be together and controlled by someone and was split up to keep things safe. Maybe some god or some other legendary type folk lore could exist for the stones and previous owners/users of it. Riley mentions The Arcane Seminary might have some info about these or at least if they are magical items. Although Riley couldn't identify the type of magic from them so that may not be a direct relation. (Riley knew it was magic but not what kind). Lucius mentioned that Thaena Nalore also has a large collection of information at their library but not really related to arcane magic. Zraxyon has a smaller library that focuses on arcane magic and is close by. Riley is pretty confident this is some type of arcane magic but still can't figure out exactly what is going on. 

As we start traveling, we happened to come across a weirdly large and alive bush inside the forest that is outside of Tharum'zuun. The forest is basically all dead which is why this bush stands out.  After a bit of talking and trying to figure out what it is, Riley decided to cast Toll the Dead on it to see if it was something dangerous. It begins to approach us. It throws a zombie at us and starts smashing us with its vines. After a few rounds we are able to take it down. 

Riley decides to dig around the dead bodies and cut off vines to see if she can find any seeds. She ended up finding a seed and put it into a jar. 

We decided to take a rest. It was fairly uneventful other than a bit of a rainstorm that rolled in towards the end of our rest. After a bit more traveling the next day, we got out of the forest and are back onto more open and rocky terrain
