Date might be wrong. Not much detail because i only started this on session 3. 

We chased into the jungle trying to follow some tracks. Eventually came across some giant spiders. We leveled up after killing them and while checking some near by dead bodies we found a note with some descriptions of people who had washed up on the beach.
