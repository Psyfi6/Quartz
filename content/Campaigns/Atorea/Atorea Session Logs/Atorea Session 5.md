We opened up the leaders chest and found a bunch of gold. We continued exploring the cave. We came across another chest that had some potions. we killed a few more orcs. Everyone was hurting pretty bad as we blew through most of our spells for healing and even used a couple healing potions. We continued exploring the cave and found a few guys who we warned what we would do to them and they ran away. We kept exploring more and ended up finding a bag of holding and a coin of delving. Before taking a rest in the cave we went to check on the guys who were left outside of the cave but they had been freed. We decide to take a long rest in the deepest part of the cave since we can safely with only one path to get to us. We take some time to rest and eat and by the time we clear the rest of the cave early morning we are heading towards the entrance of the cave around 6:00am. Sky looks clear and looking like it should be a nice day. We are expecting to arrive at "Home" in the early afternoon.
