Ran through the forest for a while. eventually lost the tracks and decided to rest for the night. Isabella found us during the night and said the rest of the people on the beach got taken. Gumash was trying to escape camp. we caught him and he confessed that his "people" capture people from the lost ships and use them as slaves and eats them or what ever else is useful. It seems like lots of ships wash up here often. Not sure what the island is called. its just referred to as "the island". Asked him a bunch of useful info about the island and who he works for and what hes done so far. including murdering the first dragonborn and then taking away the gnomes. "Cave" is north. "Home" is east from the cave. Home is on the beach. Cave is in the jungle. Roughly a half day to get from Cave to Home. We tied up gumash to a tree near the entrance of the cave. We rolled for stealth and started walking into the entrance of the cave. We heard some talk about eating donkey and started heading towards those people to try and catch them off guard.
