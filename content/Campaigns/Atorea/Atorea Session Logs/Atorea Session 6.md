Characters leveled up to 3 at the start of the session. We started heading towards "Home". After some time traveling we came across a set of tracks that seemed to go into another cave. While standing here investigating we also noticed we could hear some sound of the waves and the smell of saltwater. We noticed some figured near the entrance of the cave. We had Valis, Lucius, and Riley, sneak up to get a better view. They noticed it was Gumash and Sinni. After a bit of talk with them through Message, they mentioned they were hurt and something had attacked them (claws marks). They told us they were safe in their current location and we could approach them. They mentioned that it looked like some kind of monkey and it ran into the cave chasing after the others. We also asked Gumash about "Home" and the ship that they have at "Home" and said the cave we were standing at is "Home" and the ship is inside the cave. We head inside the cave and spot a bunch of dead bodies as well as a large ship that seems to be in need of some repairs. As we start approaching the ship we see a very large gorilla type creature wrap around from behind the ship and start charging at us. Not long into combat we see another one come charging at us from another part of the cave. We meet head on with these creatures and fight as a group to take them on. We were able to take them down without taking too many casualties or damage. Lucius was able to cast some healing for us to top up most of the injured people.
