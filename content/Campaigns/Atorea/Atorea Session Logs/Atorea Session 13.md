Party Leveled up to level 4 at the start of this session


We decided we would look for a spell scroll of "Gentle Repose" to help preserve the body of the prince. We ended up paying 125 gold for one at a shop in Udoprax. We brought it back to Amphor who was waiting outside town with the carriage. Riley reads the spell scroll. 

We then head into a quiet area in town to get rooms to sleep. Riley decided to cover the costs for everyone. 

While we all sat at a bath house in the end of the day, we talked about our plan going forward. We decided we wanted to come clean to Amphor about our involvement and decide what makes the most sense going forward. 

We decided to tell Amphor about what happened and he said "he believes us" but at the same time he is not the one who is going to be making decisions about the outcome of this situation. 

We asked Amphor what he knows about [[REDACTED INFO]] #1. He says that person is [[REDACTED INFO]] #1.1
