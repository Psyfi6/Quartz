As we get off the boat we notice the "flags" around the docks are different from the normal ones that we would have seen at Sunhollow. Everyone was giving us weird looks like why we were there but the other dragonborn vouched for us that we were good to be here. We decided to head into town to the Dragons Roost. As we walked in people continued to watch us wondering why we were there. Although Lucius and Oof were able to put on a musical performance that got the crowd into things and everyone was able to relax a bit. Valis explained to our group once we were out of the tavern that we need to help a group prevent an assassination. This assassination could lead to destabilization of the region and spark a civil war. There would be a large number of casualties on both sides and Drakenguard as a whole could be left in a weak state and vulnerable to an attack from other regions/races. We did some shopping in town where we bought some new armor, weapons, potions before we left for this mission. We ended up having Oof's pet donkey stay at a local stable so she can be safe.
