We left the town as we began out travel towards our destination. We ended up coming across a weird scene in the woods. Along a footpath was a set of statues that did not seem like typical statues. Not like a sculpted statue. After we approached closer to investigate we were ambushed by a group of basilisks. Riley unfortunately looked at one before we knew what was going on. She slowly became one of these statues. We had noticed a potion in the hands of one of the other statues that had not turned to stone and it looked like the person was trying to drink it before they turned to stone. Vulcan tried to run over and grab it but failed to break it free from the stone hands holding it. Vulcan disappointed with his lack of brawn, decided to try and use brains to deal with the situation. He had Blaze come over and teleport the two of them away while Vulcan was holding the potion. As they arrived from the teleport Vulcan still had the potion in his hand. Vulcan then went and rubbed some of this potion on the eyes of the stone Riley. After a few more rounds we killed off the rest of the basilisks and the potion ended up turning Riley back to normal. We healed up a bit then investigated the structure near by. In one of the bedrooms we found a mysterious hat. Hat of vermin. Riley decided to burn the down the structure after we left. We harvested the basilisks and came out with the following items.
3x basilisk teeth
3x basilisk eyes
6 vials of basilisk of bile
