We start off the session in the middle of combat. After one or two more rounds Oof was able to get the finishing blow against the vampire creature as he threw a javelin into its back. Oof went down into the pit to retrieve his javelin, although while down there he came across some big snail type creature that was using bones as its shell. Bones of all the previous people who died in this spot. We pulled Oof back up but and the snail followed him up. We killed the snail and it let out a loud screech that made those near by feel like their bones were curling. Not long after there was a second snail that came up but Valis was able to take that one out before it got too close to us. We took some time to heal up and search some near by bodies. We found a Potion of Fire Breathing. After crossing the pit, we came across another tunnel and followed that for what was probably 2 hours. 

We came across a larger opening and a small bridge. As we started crossing the bridge we heard some manic laughing. We tried to hurry across the bridge but before we could get to the other side we were attacked by harpies. Lucius and Valis failed their saves against the harpies and attempted to move towards them which lead them off the bridge. Lucius fell and hit the ground and snapped out of it and was able to cast feather fall on Valis who was coming down shortly after him. Oof, Riley, and Vulcan finished off the harpies and then used some rope to climb down to Lucius and Valis.

The party decided to find a spot to rest for the night. During one of the watches there was some skittering noises but the creature left without causing us any trouble. We finished our long rest.
