We continued traveling. After a bit more walking we decided to stop and rest. We found a small cave and set up shelter there. We had a rotation for watch but it was a quiet night. The next morning as we continued on we noticed some marks on the path that looked like fresh tracks from a carriage. It was headed towards Zraxyon (Drakenguard) but we don't know if it stopped there or kept going. As we got into Zraxyon we got some weird looks from the other dragonborn characters there but with the group being in the presence of Vulcan they mostly get a quick look and then are left alone. As we walked through town we had a group of dragonborns call us over to a dark alley where they talked about the plan for the fight again the potential assassins. They discussed how they want to take the fight at a specific ravine along the path and push some rocks down the road and have it fall down onto their caravan. They mentioned that they would be okay with joining us to help keep suspicion down from the non-dragonborns in Drakenguard. As we discuss within our party whats going on with these guys and what the plan is. Riley mentions she captured a recording of one of the guys names. We discussed a bit more what we want to do and then eventually headed back towards the other dragonborns to confirm the plan.
