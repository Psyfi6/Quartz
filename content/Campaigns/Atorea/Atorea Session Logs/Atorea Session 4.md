The orcs in the cave heard us and they started running at us. We kill a few of them and continue further into the cave. We come across a room full of prisoners who were the same ones at the beach. After releasing them we continued into the cave exploring more and came across another group of orcs. One of them seemed to be a bit bigger and stronger. Maybe the leader? After a tough combat we were able to take him down.
