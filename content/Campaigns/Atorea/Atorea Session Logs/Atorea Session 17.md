We spend a few days traveling the rest of the way towards the great scar. As we approach the great scar we can see the large ravine. Lucius shoots a arrow with light on it so that it can light up the path as it drops down. Vulcan decides to use Wild Companion to summon an owl and then uses beast sense on the owl so that he can see/hear from the owl for an hour. The owl decides to fly down to the bottom on the ravine. It sees lots of broken bones, rags, clothes, etc. Some of the bodies had what looks like climbing gear. They may have fell while trying to climb down or up. There are a few different ropes or other setups that would have been used to assist climbers down. As the owl flies further, it comes across an old camp. So its clear there was at one point a group who successfully got down here with supplies. The owl also sees a small crack in the side of the wall that goes east (towards Tharum'zuun). The owl decides to keep flying to head towards some large structures. There are large stone structures that appear to have fallen into the ravine. The work of the structures is like nothing we have seen before in the local cities. (As if created by some prior civilization). After checking out the stone structures, the owl turns back around to go check out the crack in the wall. after about 100 feet it opens up a bit and appears to be like it was dug out by some person/thing. After flying even more it appears to be a number of tunnels that fork off from the main tunnel i was following. The owl decides to take the right-right tunnel. This tunnel seems to basically have been a dead end. The owl turns around and heads back to the right-left tunnel. This is the one that continued fairly straight from the original path. after a bit more travel the owl came across a larger area. There seemed to be a pit filled with larger rocks as if you could jump from one to another to try and cross the pit. The owl saw a number of bodies and bones spread throughout the pit. Just on the other side of the pit the owl noticed some different type of terrain. Almost looking like some kind of water or something. But as the owl was noticing that, it heard a growl and Vulcan lost connection with it.


Vulcan, Oof, Lucius, Valis decided to jump down together. As we neared the bottom, Lucius casted feather fall on all of us. Vulcan decided to take a rest once we land while we waited for Riley to get down to the bottom since she decided to use spider climb to get down. We checked out the bodies near the bottom but there was nothing of interest there. We decided to continue moving forward towards the stone structures that the owl had saw. Riley was able to investigate the stone and determine that it was significantly older than anything we would have thought of previously. Confirming like it was some kind of ancient civilization that made these. Vulcan asks Riley if she had ever read up on anything about this stuff. Riley has not ever heard of anything like this. Vulcan then asks Lucius how he heard about this sword and Lucius mentioned that someone in Sunhollow told him about it. There was somebody who had a rumour about this item and decided to sell it to Lucius when they bumped into each other at the World Piece Trade Fair at Sunhollow. Lucius decided to tie a rope and jump down into a smaller crack below that had some water running into it but there was nothing there. 

We then decided to turn back and go towards that small tunnel the owl had previously found. Vulcan casted Pass without a Trace so that we could sneak around since we know there was some other creature where we were heading. As we approach the pit we hear this screech come from the ceiling as this monster projectile pukes on us. We take a bunch of necrotic damage and are unable to heal for 10 rounds. The creature jumps down and took a few swings at Vulcan and took a bite of him leaving him down to only 3 hp. Vulcan was able to wildshape into an Ape in an attempt to stay alive. Oof was able to get in the face of this creature and hold him off while Lucius' Slow spell kept this creature from doing too much damage.
