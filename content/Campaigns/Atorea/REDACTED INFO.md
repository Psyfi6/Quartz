## Redacted Info Usage
Reference number should be used to link the primary name/location/information and events or information is used for various events or additional details we learn about this thing. 

Example: 
- Index Table:
	- Jim is someone we learn about but that info is redacted so Jim would become a unique reference number and in a session log you can refer to Jim as Redacted Info #1. 
- Events or Information Table
	- Then lets say we learn about Jim's death, we can create an event that uses reference number 1 to link to Jim and that event is also given a unique number. So if we wanted to write in a session log that we learned about Jim's death, we would refer to it as Redacted Info #1.1


## Encrypt/Decrypt
Session logs will always refer to the redacted info as its difficult to maintain proper backwards compatibility without missing stuff. When a new entry is created it will be redacted and things will refer to the redacted index and events. When that info becomes public, the redacted info page (This page) will be decrypted for that specific set of information and then when you are reading through that session log, you will be able to see the decrypted information. Once information is no longer redacted, it can be referred to directly in a session log rather than pointing to our index/event tables.
