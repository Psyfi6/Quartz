## Discovery from Hermit 
In a dream, a woman came to him. Long black hair, tanned skin, blue eyes, sleek green dress. Very beautiful. Warns him about a group of Dragonborn in Drakenguard trying to find these special stones that, rumor has it, will revive an ancient evil that will threaten the lives of Atorea. Not a lot of detail, but the stones are about the size of an egg, each one representing each color of chromatic dragon. Basically said they had to be found before the rogue Dragonborn do, and destroyed. She gave some info about where the stones might be located. The black one is rumored to be "at the eye's peak". The red one was last seen "at the center of the sun". The blue one is "floating within the clouds".



## Notes
- I assumed that "Center of the sun" was referencing "Sunhallow". I assumed the stone may be traded during this World Peace Trade Fair. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find anything. Next guess is the Wyrm's Eye in Drakenguard ("At the Eye's peak").
