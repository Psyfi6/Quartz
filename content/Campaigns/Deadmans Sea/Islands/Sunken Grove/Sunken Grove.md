## Description
[[Sunken Grove]] is a medium sized island that appears to be sinking. In the middle of the island is a lake that has things like trees growing in it which typically wouldn't be possible unless the tree has sunken underwater after it had grown. Other then the lake in the middle the island hosts a large variety of life across its forests and small mountains on the north side of the island.


#### Ideas
some kind of hidden secret that was why this island started sinking? [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Aristocratic Order/Valorridge]] has been trying to figure out whats going on?
