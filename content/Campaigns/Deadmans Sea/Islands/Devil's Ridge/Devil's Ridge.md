## Description
[[Devil's Ridge]] is a very hot island with an active volcano. There is very little life on the island as the lack of water and constant fires has killed most trees and grass. 

People claim that the reason for this volcano becoming active and staying active is that it is used as a gate to and from the underworld. It was opened up by devils and they are the ones who mainly live on the island. 

[[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Minor/Servants of the Flame]] are common on Devil's Ridge as they are worshipers of [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Deities/Hades]] and the Underworld.
