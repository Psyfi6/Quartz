## Description
[[Sandy Shallows]] is a cluster of small islands off the west coast of [[Eldoria]]. People believe they are a continuation of the mountains that move across Eldoria. The small islands have made life difficult to sustain due to the violent storms that seem to wash away most of the surface.
