## Description

[[Celestia]] is the city furthest from [[Eldoria]]. Its located on [[Discovery Outpost]] which is used as a common area for people to restock on supplies or stay for a few nights to get some rest. The diverse environment makes a great place to gather resources for the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Commerce Coalition/Industrialists]] and [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Minor/The Iron Legion]]. This is a fairly friendly place because it takes teamwork to survive this far from the mainland.
