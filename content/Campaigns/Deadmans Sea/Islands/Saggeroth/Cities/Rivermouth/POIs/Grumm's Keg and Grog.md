## Description
Nestled in the heart of the village, this rustic tavern beckons weary travelers with its inviting glow and lively atmosphere. The exterior, adorned with weathered wooden beams and a swinging sign bearing the tavern's name, exudes a quaint charm. Upon entering, patrons are greeted by the warm embrace of a crackling hearth, casting flickering shadows across sturdy wooden tables and benches worn smooth by countless gatherings. The air is rich with the scent of hearty stew and roasting meats, mingling with the heady aroma of ale and mead. A jovial bard strums a lute in one corner, their melodies weaving tales of valor and adventure. Behind the worn bar counter, shelves groan under the weight of countless bottles and kegs, offering a dizzying array of libations to quench any thirst. Despite its modest size, Grumm's Keg and Grog is a haven of camaraderie and merriment, where strangers become friends over a shared drink and the promise of new tales to be told.
