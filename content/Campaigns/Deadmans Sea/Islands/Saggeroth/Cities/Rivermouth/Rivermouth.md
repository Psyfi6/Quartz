## Description
At the mouth of a calm river, this idyllic village exudes a sense of serenity and charm. Calm waters gently lap against the wooden docks where fishing boats bob lazily. The villagers, with smiles upon their faces, bustle about their daily routines amidst a mix of stone, wood, and thatch buildings. Quaint streets wind their way through the village, lined with colorful flower boxes and market stalls. Despite its modest size, Rivermouth is a vibrant community where laughter and camaraderie fill the air.
