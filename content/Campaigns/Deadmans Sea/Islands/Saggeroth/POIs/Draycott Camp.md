## Description
Nestled amidst rolling hills. Tents and makeshift shelters dot the landscape, housing soldiers, miners, and camp staff alike. Bonfires cast flickering light upon the scene, their warmth warding off the chill of the night. The clang of metal on metal echoes from a makeshift forge, where blacksmiths toil to keep weapons and armor in peak condition. Miners return from the depths with precious ore, their faces streaked with sweat and grime. Amidst the bustle, a sense of camaraderie prevails, as allies and friends stand united in their shared purpose.
