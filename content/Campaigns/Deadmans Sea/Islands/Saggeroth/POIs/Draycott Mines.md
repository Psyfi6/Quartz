## Description
Carved deep into the heart of the earth, the Draycott Mines sprawl beneath rugged terrain. Within the dimly lit tunnels, the faint scuttle of bugs echoes against the stone walls, a testament to the ancient depths of this subterranean realm. Minetracks stretch out like veins, weaving through the labyrinthine passages, guiding miners as they transport precious ore and supplies.

Further into the depths lies a vast chamber, illuminated by the fiery glow of molten lava that courses through the earth. Here, amidst the heat and haze, stands an impressive forge, its flames dancing in mesmerizing patterns as skilled blacksmiths ply their trade. Camp supplies are scattered nearby, a testament to the perseverance of those who toil within these unforgiving depths.

Despite the dangers that lurk in the shadows, the Draycott Mines remain a beacon of opportunity for those brave enough to venture into the depths.
