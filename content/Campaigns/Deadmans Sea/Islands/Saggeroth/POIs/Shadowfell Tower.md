## Description
Rising ominously from a desolate landscape shrouded in death and decay, the Shadowfell Tower looms tall and foreboding. Its dark stone spire seems to pierce the very heavens, casting a long shadow that stretches across the barren land. Eerie whispers fill the air, carrying tales of lost souls and ancient curses. The tower exudes an aura of otherworldly power, hinting at the dark magic that dwells within its ancient walls.


## Notes
#### Second floor puzzle
#### Description
The group walks up onto the next floor. They stand in the middle of a ring of pillars and what appears to be some reflective doorways. Upon closer inspection each doorway seems to be a mirror. It mimics all of your actions and movements.



## DM INFO ONLY
The mirrors are magically so they can not be broken. Any attempts to get through the mirror will have the mirrored PC do the same movement and block their attempt at getting through.Â   
Players need to move to the side and gesture the reflection to come through. "You first". The mirror will do the same gesture but allow the players through.
