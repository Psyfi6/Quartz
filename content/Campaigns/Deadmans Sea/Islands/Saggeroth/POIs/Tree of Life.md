## Description
A massive tree surrounded by shallow crystal clear water and fog fills the air all around. Wisps of energy flow through its branches as it illuminates the sky around it. The Tree of Life is what keeps this island living. It creates the animals, the resources, the other trees and grass. 

It is rumored to be able to bring dead creatures back to life if the right ritual is performed.


## Notes
#### Reviving a character
Tree of Life is an area where players can make a sacrifice to bring life back to something. 

A mix of some of the following: 

- Absorbing the life of evil things
- Evil creatures from the shadowfell area (ghouls, banshees, any other unnatural things. natural things would be things like bears, wolfs.)
- humanoids who have become aligned with evil and perform evil tasks
- evil objects
- Performing a ritual similar to [https://twitter.com/matthewmercer/status/824054305355247616](https://twitter.com/matthewmercer/status/824054305355247616)[](https://twitter.com/matthewmercer/status/824054305355247616)

Players would lay the body down into the shallow water and perform what ever they are performing. The process takes time and this area is crawling with life forms. 

This tree is what creates life on this island. The animals, the grass, the trees. There will be lots of wild animals around as well.
