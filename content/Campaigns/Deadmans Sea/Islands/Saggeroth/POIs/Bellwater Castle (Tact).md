## Description
Perched atop a towering cliff, Bellwater Castle commands a breathtaking view of the endless expanse of the ocean. Its sturdy stone walls, adorned with banners bearing the sigil of the ruling family, rise majestically against the backdrop of the azure sky. Battlements jut skyward, casting imposing shadows upon the rugged landscape below. A winding path leads through a gated entrance, guarded by vigilant sentinels in gleaming armor. Within the castle's walls lie sprawling gardens filled with vibrant blooms, their colors a stark contrast to the rugged cliffs and crashing waves below. At the heart of the castle stands a grand hall, where nobles gather to feast and celebrate amidst opulent tapestries and flickering torchlight. From its lofty perch, Bellwater Castle stands as a symbol of strength and sovereignty.
