## Appearance 
A spectral figure draped in tattered, seaweed-covered garments. His eyes glow with an eerie, otherworldly light, and his translucent form emits a faint, ethereal mist. Tarnished trinkets dangle from his skeletal fingers, whispering of lost treasures and forgotten voyages.


## Notes
Captain Blackwood should show up when the players either disturb the ship too much or find the Whisky. He will be aggressive since he is angry about how he was murdered.Â 

"How dare you come into my ship and disturb me. Nobody deserves this whisky after what was done to me."
