## Appearance 
A spirited halfling woman with a warm smile that lights up her freckled face. Her hair, a wild tangle of curls, is often tucked beneath a worn leather hat adorned with feathers. Despite her petite stature, she exudes happiness as she tends to her beloved horses, her hands deft and sure as she brushes their coats and tends to their needs. Her stable is a sanctuary of peace and harmony.
