## Appearance 
A slender, hooded figure adorned in shimmering celestial robes. His single hand emits an otherworldly glow, while his piercing eyes hold the secrets of the cosmos. Clutching a staff crowned with a pulsating crystal orb, he exudes an aura of mystique and arcane power.


## Notes
He is the leader of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Order of the Divine]]. Some believe the gods have given him some powers to help him on his mission of spreading the word of the gods.



After being rescued, Bizom gives the party a [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Notable Items/Bizom's Ring]]
