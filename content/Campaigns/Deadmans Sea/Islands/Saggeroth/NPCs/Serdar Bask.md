## Appearance 
A dignified human with silver-streaked hair and piercing blue eyes that reflect a lifetime of wisdom. His tailored robes bear the emblem of his office, and a polished amulet hangs around his neck. Despite his advanced age, he carries himself with a spry vigor, exuding authority tempered with compassion as he oversees the affairs of his humble village.
