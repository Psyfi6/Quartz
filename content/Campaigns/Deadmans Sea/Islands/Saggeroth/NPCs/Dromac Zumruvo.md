## Appearance 
A towering dragonborn clad in gleaming silver armor adorned with intricate runes. His piercing blue eyes exude wisdom and determination, and his scales shimmer with a faint iridescence. Twin lightning-shaped scars mark his cheeks, hinting at battles won and challenges overcome. He wields a massive warhammer crackling with elemental energy, a symbol of his strength and valor.
