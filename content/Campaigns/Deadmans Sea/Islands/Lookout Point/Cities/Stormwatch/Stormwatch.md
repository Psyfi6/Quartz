## Description
[[Stormwatch]] is a small city on [[Lookout Point]]. It is used as a temporary shelter for many sea travelers. Being in the northern part of the world, the water has chunks of ice floating around and the ground on the island is frozen. Cold winds roll in off the shores. The name "Stormwatch" has become a popular description for the location because many are forced to dock here as they wait out a storm. 

People here are very welcoming and ready to help out where needed. Offering shelter and supplies for your short stay. It is also used as a sort of research outpost as it has easier access to open waters and the rolling hills and snow covered pine has created a unique environment for some animals not typically seen elsewhere.
