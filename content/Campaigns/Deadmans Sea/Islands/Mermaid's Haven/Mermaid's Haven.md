## Description
From afar you can see beautiful beaches with tall palm trees and some luscious hills covered with flowers. It looks warm and welcoming. As you approach you can hear the hum of a lovely song. 

If you continue to approach the island you start to notice a fog fills the air as you approach.



## Players Enter the Island
If the players continue to move towards the island after the notice the fog then have them roll a constitution save. DC 17? If the players fail they become charmed and attempt to charm others who are not already charmed. Asking them things like can you smell the fresh air? Do you hear that lovely song being sung? Increase DC by 1 for each player around them that is charmed. Roll again regularly. Once all players are charmed they feel as if they are starting to lose connection to their bodies and soon things go black and they don't remember anything. 

Once they wake up they are in a small shelter with food and water but are surrounded by large walls on every side. There is a few openings though. As they approach the openings they can see that the walls continue to wind and turn and they notice they are in a maze.

The players must survive and escape the maze. (kind of similar concept to maze runner movie). If the players manage to escape the maze they will escape into a jail within the settlement on the island. There they will be questioned by the people guarding the island on why they are there and what they know about the island. 

Successfully escaping the maze is a sort of initiation test to see how capable those people are and they might attempt to recruit them or press them for more info. 




## DM ONLY 
Mermaid's Haven is the birth place of arcane magic. Originally found by the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]]. They did not know enough about magic to feel comfortable making use of it at the time. They created a small settlement that would research magic and protect the island from others.

The reason the island appears the way it does is because there is a illusion spell being cast around the island.

Players may learn about the raw magic that is created here on this island. It will sometimes be brought back to people in other parts of the world. Such as providing it to the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Aristocratic Order/Steelguard]] family for them to make magical gear. There has also been instances of people escaping the island with either knowledge of this magic or with some of the resources as well as transport boats carrying this stuff being hijacked by pirates. This is what lead to the widespread discovery and usage of magic.
