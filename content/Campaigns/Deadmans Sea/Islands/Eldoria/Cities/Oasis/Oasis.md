## Description 
[[Oasis]] is a low spot in the desert on the south end of [[Eldoria]]. Along the coast line and at the bottom of the towering mountain [[Mount Olympus]] that is north of the city. Oasis is one of the few spots within the desert that is able to provide sustainable life. The fine sand filters the water as it reaches Oasis making it drinkable. Being a small town that is somewhat difficult to travel to has made it into a busy port for shady business. Both the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Minor/Sea Serpent's Scourge]] and the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Minor/Black Flag Buccaneers]] operate their main bases in Oasis. Both of them are dangerous groups who make their presence known within the city.
