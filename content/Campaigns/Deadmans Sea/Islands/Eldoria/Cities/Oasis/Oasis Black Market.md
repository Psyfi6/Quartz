## Trades & Storage
- Oasis is a pirate ruled city. You can typically bring in your stolen goods directly into town looking for traders/contacts. Only concern would be other crews potentially looking to take goods from you (although uncommon) or items which may have you looked down upon, such as slaves.
- There are some merchants who regularly visit Oasis and will trade with you directly. Although typically merchants would be posted up in Sunvale and just have workers dealing with trades. In this situation, they have set prices that are lower than normal. Its either take the price or find someone else. They have a set list of what they will accept as well.
- It may take some time to build up renown within the city and get familiar with what traders are willing to buy what. You also don't typically know the name of the actual merchant/store that would be set up in Sunvale. For example, if you walked into Oasis for the first time with a ship full of slaves, you likely wouldn't find a single trader willing to buy them off of you.


## Contraband Levels
- ### Notes
	- Rough idea of where items would categorize in terms of prices/difficulty to move/sell. Items may move around depending on their size, value, importance, general risk/danger levels to others. I magical paper that can easily erase what's on it likely wouldn't be considered overly dangerous other than the fact is has magical properties. A magical sword on the other hand could be considered very dangerous in the wrong hands. 
	- Quantities of items could also change the levels of something. If you had access to a huge amount of dyes which may have disrupted a normal delivery of them, this might raise more suspicion. 
	- Prices will heavily vary throughout seasons, available contacts, location, etc. Food/Water might not be worth a whole lot during middle of summer compared to middle of winter.

## Behind the Scenes Merchant POV
- Merchants use fake names when interacting with the city of Oasis. They usually don't spend much time within Oasis and have a very secure communication channels and management who handle purchases/storage/transportation of contraband. 
- These goods will be brought into Sunvale and sold through legit channels, typically the stores within Sunvale. 
- Merchants will usually offer around 50% of the value of items since they have to deal with bringing it into the city, selling it, making some profit off of it, and the risk associated with it.
