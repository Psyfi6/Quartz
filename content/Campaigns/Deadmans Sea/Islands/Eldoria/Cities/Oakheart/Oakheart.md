## Description
[[Oakheart]] is the second largest city on [[Eldoria]]. Build in the dense boreal forest that is northeast of [[Sunvale]]. Oakheart has no access to the coastline so they primarily make their living through hunting and resource gathering. They produce a lot of the lumber and ore for the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Commerce Coalition/Industrialists]] and [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Minor/The Iron Legion]]. 

The [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Aristocratic Order/Ashhide]] family and the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Aristocratic Order/Steelguard]] family were originally from this area and have a lot of respect from the people of Oakheart. They are a big reason why Oakheart is what it is today.
