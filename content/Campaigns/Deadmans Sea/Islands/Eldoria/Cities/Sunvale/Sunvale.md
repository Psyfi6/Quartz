## Description

The heart of [[Eldoria]]. Sunvale was the first implementation of the idea for a modern society using the benefits of a city ([[Deadmans Sea/World Info/History/Timeline Events/Lumess Family Establishes Sunvale]]). The idea originated from the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]] and being the visionaries of the city, they were the original rulers of it. After the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/History/Timeline Events/Eldoria Revolution]], the Lumess Family was dethroned. The citizens of Sunvale still believe in a lot of the original ideas of working together and helping each other out. This has prevented the state of things from deteriorating. Currently, the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Aristocratic Order]] has a lot of say in what happens within the city but there is no true top of the ladder. 

Along the northwest side of the of city is where the nobles live. Things up there are kept very well. Its clean, beautiful, and spacious. City guards are often patrolling the area and will regularly screen people attempting to go into the area. 

The northeast side of the city is owned by the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Commerce Coalition]]. The [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Commerce Coalition/Merchant Alliance]] live along the coast just behind their strip of stores. Below them is the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Commerce Coalition/Industrialists]] who have their own set of houses in a more public area but all of their manufacturing is in a walled area with restricted access. Just to the east of these 2 areas is the docks. Close access for the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Commerce Coalition]] who makes regular use of the docks and even have their own private dock. 

The west side of the city is full of amenities and city services. The town square, city hall, library, schools, and some farm land. There is also a number of smaller traders set up along the west side of town who are not part of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Commerce Coalition]]. 

The centre of the city is filled with people who live a comfortable life. They have good jobs and decent houses. South of that is the lower end area of the city where people who want the protection of the city but cant afford much end up living. 

The whole city is walled off from the wild and hugs the coast line. A manmade seawall protects the docks during storms and the lighthouse helps guide incoming ships towards thee city.
