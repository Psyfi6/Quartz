The Sunvale Harmony Festival was a celebration created by the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]] in the very early days of the creation of Sunvale. To celebrate the success of the city, they would host this festival that strongly represented the social support that being part of the city offers.

The Sunvale Harmony Festival is hosted on the midway point of the first month of summer. 
- Every non-public facing worker has the day off. Miners, blacksmiths, etc would have the day off. Traders have to work that day.
- There is an extra pay period created for this specific day where everyone gets paid so they can go and spend their money at the festival.
- Traders from all over the world come to the Sunvale Harmony Festival to show off their goods.
- The city also gives out free food and drink to everyone. 
- The city pays for any traveler who needs a room to stay at for the night. 


The concept of the festival was to help boost moral by giving everyone a day to enjoy and to show off to the rest of the world what things could look like if they moved to the city. There is tons of supplies brought to the city in the weeks leading up as merchants stock their shelves and the city prepares to host a huge influx of people. Massive amounts of wealth are transferred throughout the city that day as people happily spend their money at various traders.


Another big part of the festival is the Arena games. People sign up for non-lethal combat in a gladiator style fight. There are skill based challenges to see who is the best of the best. Some people join the games for fun, some join to earn recognition and respect, some join to try and win prizes.
