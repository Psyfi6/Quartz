## Description
[[Solstice]] marks the point of the extreme change in environment. Through the forest around [[Oakheart]] and over the mountain ridge. The north side of [[Eldoria]] is a cold frozen tundra where life is extremely difficult. Solstice is a small town that provides some shelter to those who live beyond the mountains.
