## Description
[[Eldoria]] is the mainland of the world. Where humanoid life started out. There are a number of different biomes that stretch across the large island. 

Starting at the north side of Eldoria it is very cold and stays frozen year round. There are some areas with thicker forest and a dry desert that has now been covered with snow and ice. In this wintery biome is the city of [[Solstice]]. At the south side of the winter biome is a large line of mountains that move east to west across the entire island. On the other side of those mountains is a thick boreal forest which is home to the city of [[Oakheart]]. 

Along the west coast of Eldoria is [[Sunvale]] the capital city of the world. Outside of [[Sunvale]] there are rolling hills and a mix of some prairies. 

As you continue south you come across a dry desert with a mountain that reaches beyond the clouds. Within the desert is the city of [[Oasis]].
