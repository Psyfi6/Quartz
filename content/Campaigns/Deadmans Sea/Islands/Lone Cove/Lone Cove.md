## Description
[[Lone Cove]] is a small chunk of land off the coast of the wintery biome on [[Eldoria]]. It is believed that the ocean up here used to be filled with large ice chunks that created a natural bridge to walk across from Eldoria onto Lone Cove. While there are still large ice chunks here its unlikely animals would be able to cross without being able to swim between them.
