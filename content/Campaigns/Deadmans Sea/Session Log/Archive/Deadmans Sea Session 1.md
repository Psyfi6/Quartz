Players got their gear had a good meal at the [[Grumm's Keg and Grog]] and went onto their adventure. They followed the road over to the farm outside of town. Before reaching the farm they came across a campsite that was setup. While approaching the campsite they encountered 4 [[Giant-Hyena]]. The party was able to deal with the Hyenas and searched around the campsite. They found a bit of coinage left in a backpack and that was it. They passed by the farm and headed towards the [[Shadowfell Tower]]. About 1-2 hours before the reaching the Shadowfell area they rested in a lightly treed area. Throughout the night they noticed some [[Giant-Owl]] flying above but they seemed to disappear for some time. Later into the night they came back. They must not have found food elsewhere and returned to the party in search of food. The party dealt with the Owls in quick fashion and continued with their rest. As the sun rises they packed up their tents and continued along their route, reaching the edge of Shadowfell. They stair at what lays ahead, a dark lifeless valley filled with fog.
