[[Tarkus]] Switched our for [[Rain]]

The party got back into town and did some shopping at [[Glimmering Gear]] plus asked the shop keep ([[Tharendel Swiftfoot]]) to put some items on hold. They also said farewell to [[Tarkus]] as he just wasn't able to handle this work anymore. Walking away from the group angry about the situation, he bumped into [[Rain]] on the street and almost knocked her down. The rest of the party noticed and went to assure she was okay. They invited her to join them at [[Grumm's Keg and Grog]] as an apology. While having some drinks they had some fun and offered for Rain to join them in their adventures. After a night of drinks and food the party went to bed and then in the morning headed out to meet with [[Tact Bellwater]]. After getting to the [[Bellwater Castle (Tact)]] they are greeted by Tact and have some discussion. They ask Tact a few questions about [[Shadowfell Tower]] but Tact tries to deflect the questions and asks the party some questions. After a bit of time its clear to the party that Tact was involved and is a wealthy and powerful person. It is also clear to Tact that this is the group of people who cleared out the tower and the [[Draycott Mines]] and that they are very capable and he would like to hire them to help him out with stuff since he clearly needs more sophisticated group of mercenaries. After some internal discussion, the party decides to accept his offer. The first job provided is finding a [[Lost Shipment]]. This was a shipment of gear and valuable resources coming from the mines that he did not want to be known about by the general public. He offered the party 50gp each if they could retrieve it and bring it back. The party left along the path provided by Tact on a map, it brings them to the south west side of the island around some forests and hills. The eventually found some blood and some tracks and followed them. They came across a napping [[saber-toothed-tiger]]. [[Drithax]] used speak with animals and had a chat with the tiger but it wasn't much help. The tiger was full and had eaten some "Tall, Squishy, Slow" food in "that direction". The party decides they will head back and follow the trail the other way.
