The party has leveled up to 4 after this session.


The Party continued through the [[Shadowfell Tower]], first dealing with a swarm of [[constrictor-snake]] which also included a [[giant-constrictor-snake]]. As the players head up to the next floor they come across a campsite. They investigate the campsite to find out that it has recently been used but is currently empty. Kazima decides to throw the dead body of the giant constrictor snake onto the fire to have a snake for later. Tarkus tries to play a prank and hides a dead body of a snake in one of the empty sleeping bags. Unfortunately, there wont be anyone to find that snake because on the next floor, the party encounters a large group of [[Duergar]]. In an intense and nearly deadly combat, the team is able to deal with the duergar's. The mix of ranged/melee attacks along with invisible and enlarged Duergar's was still not enough to stop this team. The party decides to loot the bodies and then head down to the camp below for a rest. Once rested up, the party heads up to the top floor of the tower. Here they encounter a person withered and weak and chained to the ground. They free this person and find out that this is [[Bizom Dreamhand]], the rumored "god" that was placed here to maintain the island. After freeing Bizom and helping him get to safety, Bizom explains a bit about him self and gives the party a [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Notable Items/Bizom's Ring]]. He claims this ring was gifted to him from another god. He is unsure what it does or if its worth anything but wanted you to have it. The party now sits at their camp in the forest outside of the "Shadowfell" area. Bizom has gone off on his own and the party is headed back to [[Rivermouth]] to update mayor [[Serdar Bask]] on what has happened. The party has gained 2 renown for any future interactions with Bizom Dreamhand.
