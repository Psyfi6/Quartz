The party returns to [[Rivermouth]] and finds mayor [[Serdar Bask]]. They explain to him some of the difficulties they went through at the [[Shadowfell Tower]] but that in the end the mission was a success. That they found and released [[Bizom Dreamhand]] and that they cleared out the tower. Serdar Bask agreed that it was odd to have that many [[Duergar]] grouped together with a camp. He still believes that [[Tact Bellwater]] is behind this and that he must have hired the Duergar to protect that area. As a thank you to the party, Serdar Bask gives the group 50 gold pieces from his own collection. He mentions that next time he needs to make use of the parties services he will officially contract them through the town so he can pay them better. He tells them to head to [[Grumm's Keg and Grog]] and put anything they want on his tab. Later in the evening Serdar Bask heads to the tavern to celebrate with the party. Serdar Bask tells [[Grumm Orcheck]] about the success of the party. Grumm Orcheck decides to tell the party about a [[Forgotten Whisky]] barrel that was left on the [[Abandoned Ship]]. He suggests to the party that they could rent a horse and cart from [[Pony's Pavilion]], the stable in town and head over to the abandoned ship. If they can find and recover this barrel of whisky he will give them 200 gold pieces, assuming its in good condition. He warns them of the stories of the old captain, [[Ghost of Captain Blackwood]], that haunts the ship. It is rumored that Captain Blackwood was murdered by someone from his own crew so that the crew member could claim the success of finding this island. The party has some beers and food and gets some rest before going to [[Glimmering Gear]] the next day to purchase some potions of healing and then to the stable to rent a house and cart. They then follow along the river. At one point they come across the a couple of [[saber-toothed-tiger]] that had just finished a meal and were taking a drink from the river. [[Murdock]] was able to communicate with the Tigers to negotiate a safe passage without any issues. Soon after the party finds the abandoned ship.
