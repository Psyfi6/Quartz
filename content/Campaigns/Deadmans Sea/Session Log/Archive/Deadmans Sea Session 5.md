(Greg Joins. Playing [[Drithax]])

[[Kazima]], [[Jerok]] and [[Drithax]] decide to investigate the [[Abandoned Ship]] while [[Murdock]] and [[Tarkus]] protect the horse and cart. The party enters onto the abandoned ship and notice that it has not seen any activity in a while. Things are weathered and covered in dust. They head onto the middle deck of the boat and the first door they enter into is the engine room. As they do this, they hear the door they previously entered though close. They go back and open it up. While further investigating the ship they hear that same door slam shut. At this point they begin trying to enter another door on the middle deck of the boat. Jerok tries to open a locked door but is unable to pick the lock. Drithax tries to force the door open and the door blows back into him with the same force he applied to the door. After getting back up and healing up a bit they enter into the room. This room is the captains quarters and they spot the barrel of whiskey. They also notice a chest. Jerok decides to open up the chest and finds some gold. While trying to grab the gold the chest slams closed on his hands. Jerok asks for some help holding the chest open so he can grab the gold. Drithax is able to overcome the force of the chest trying to close while Jerok grabs the gold. After splitting the gold those 3 decide to try and grab the barrel of whiskey and leave. At this point [[Ghost of Captain Blackwood]] has had enough. He tried to scare away the party but they just wont take the hints. He has appeared from the Ethereal Plane and is ready to fight for what is his.
