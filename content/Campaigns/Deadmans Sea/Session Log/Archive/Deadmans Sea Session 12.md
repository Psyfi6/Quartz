[[Drithax]] Swaps for [[Xanriel]] part way through the session
(Drithax is a good alignment character and that doesnt fit with what the party is doing. Drithax will go his own way. Xanriel will join the party in his place and he is already aligned with working for [[Tact Bellwater]].)




Fought off [[crocodile]]s, [[Rain]] went down to the bite of the [[giant-crocodile]] but the others were able to kill it before it did too much permanent damage to Rain. The party then continued on their path back to town. Once in town they stopped by to update [[Serdar Bask]] on the situation. They told him that they were pretending to work for Tact so they could collect more information on him. They also mentioned Tact seemed to be involved but wouldn't admit it. The mayor wasn't too surprised by this. After meeting with the mayor, the party went and bought some from [[Glimmering Gear]] and [[Jerok]] brought his [[giant-crocodile]] hide to a craftsman([[Dromac Zumruvo]]) who said for the price of 30 gold (already paid) he could create some studded leather armor from it. He just needed a few days. After that the party went to [[Grumm's Keg and Grog]] for some food/drinks/rest. They noticed the [[Grumm Orcheck]] wasn't there when he typically is always there. They asked the servers where he was and was informed that he's become ill over the last day or two. Nobody really thought too much into it at the time. By morning the party was ready to head out and went to the [[Rivermouth Docks]]. They noticed at the docks that Drithax was no longer with them. He must have wandered off or something on the way over. After waiting around a bit, the rest of the party members decided to get on the boat and leave since they were running out of time. While boarding the boat, they were introduced to the captain of the boat, Xanriel Minrith. Under the guidance of the captain, the party was able to find the boat and navigate the ocean through teamwork and decision making of the captain. After a few cannon shots back and forth and a near collision, they eventually ended up close enough that they could prepare to board the ship.
