[[Murdock]], [[Jerok]], [[Drithax]], [[Kazima]] start out the session in the captains quarters in a heated situation with the [[Ghost of Captain Blackwood]]. After a bit of back and forth Captain Blackwood etherealizes and is no longer around. The party decides to heal up and continue exploring the ship. They find some maps and [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Handouts/Captain Blackwood's Journal]] but not much else of interest on the ship. It was left with some food/water/bedding/equipment but was used for some time after landing it appears. The old crew must have used it as shelter until they could build some other shelter away from the haunted ship. The party ends up grabbing the barrel of whisky and bringing it to their horse and cart they had outside the ship. They end up staying the night beside a campfire by the boat. The night is mostly calm other than hearing a door on the ship slam shut. The crew makes their way back to town through some heavy rain. Once they get back into town they bring the barrel to [[Grumm Orcheck]] and he pays them the 200 gold he promised and gives each of them a glass of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Notable Items/Blackwater Whiskey]] as a thanks. As the party rests, Murdock reads through the journals of Captain Blackwood to learn of any important information.
