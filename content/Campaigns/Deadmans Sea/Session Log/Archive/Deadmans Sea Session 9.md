PARTY LEVELS TO 5 AFTER SESSION

Continued exploring the [[Draycott Mines]], found a diamond worth 140 (maybe 160) gold. After looting, they kept following the minecart tracks to the noise they could hear deeper into the cave. They found the forge room of the mines, it was being worked in by some [[Ogre]]s and [[Animated-Armor]]s. The team grabbed a minecart and did a bobsled type maneuver to crash into the Ogres working the other cart. They were very successful in their attempt and were able to get a surprise round, they jumped out and started swinging. The Animated Armors headed towards some statues on each side of the room to press a button, this spawned a type of [[Clay-Golem]] from the lava below. After an intense battle, [[Drithax]] was able to get the finishing blow on the Golem. Slicing it in half. They looted some gold off of the Ogres and a Locket that [[Murdock]] pockets, seemed to have been from a previous worker. The party takes a short rest to heal up incase they come across the morning crew of workers coming in. They get out of the mines and meet with [[Ginvol Steelpike]] again,Â  Ginvol thanks them for the help clearing the mines and since he doesnt have anything to offer right now, he says he can spend some time making them something really nice one he gets setup in the mines again. He asks for suggestions on what the party could use and then tells them to come back in about 7 days. Murdock had asked Ginvol if they had any extra work. Ginvol mentions just basic labor in the mines but figures that is well below the paygrade of the party. Although he suggests that he could give the names of the party to his boss and put in a good word for if anything comes up. The party decides that this is a good idea and then once done chatting with Ginvol they head back to [[Rivermouth]]. The party has leveled up to level 5 after clearing the mines.




#### DM INFO ONLY
Ginvol's boss is [[Tact Bellwater]], so this gives Tact another reason to like the work of the party for future considerations.
