After a bit of shopping in town at [[Glimmering Gear]] ([[Jerok]] buys a [[hat-of-wizardry-xge]] and a [[Drithax]] buys a [[potion-of-healing]]), the party decides to act on some rumors they heard about the [[Draycott Mines]] being overrun. They spend the day walking out there and find the [[Draycott Camp]] late into the night. They decide to approach and introduce them selves to the guard by the gate. The guard mentions that they could use all the help they could get since they are running low on men after all the battles they have had. Once inside the camp the party meets [[Ginvol Steelpike]], he is the leader of this crew and helps protect the workers and run this operation. Ginvol mentions that he is unable to actually delve into the mines with the party as he needs to stay out here and guard the camp that has the remaining mining equipment. The party decides to wait over night and head into the mines during the day time. Although sunlight doesnt make much of a difference as all the torches in the mine have not been kept up with so all that awaits them is darkness. Once they reach the entrance of the mines, Jerok decides to scout forward for the party. First they come across a group of [[Giant-spider]]s which they were able to take care of pretty easily minus a few blows to Drithax. Jerok got to show off his new skills by creating a bonfire to burn away some webs from the restrained Drithax and [[Kazima]]. Once the fight with the giant spiders was over, Drithax used up some potions of healing to get him self back into fighting condition and they continued forward through the tunnel. After a bit more exploring, Jerok finds a group of hungry [[brown-bear]]s feasting on the remaining of what appears to be a mine worker. Jerok blasts an arrow at the bears and lures them into the awaiting Drithax and Kazima. One bear drops and another is injured.
