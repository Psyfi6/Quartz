Players continued on with their journey towards [[Shadowfell Tower]]. They reach the Shadowfell area and see the ground slowly transition into a deathly wasteland. They continue on following the trail. Slowly moving forward watching their surroundings. After a while they see something coming towards them. This [[banshee]] was able to detect the players from far away and begin hunting them. The players engaged the banshee. They make quick work of it and while the Banshee is fleeing, Murdock blasts it away with his moonbeam. The players finally reach the Shadowfell tower and with some investigation notice that there is nothing near by. They decide to take a long rest outside the building. Surprisingly, the full moon night was uneventful. Howling could be heard in the distance but nothing approached. The players moved into the tower discovering a pack of [[Gnoll]]s. After some combat with the Gnolls the players headed up to the second floor of the tower. Here they encountered a room filled with mirrors. Tarkus was the first to crack the magical mystery. After a simple gesture (you first) to his reflection, his reflection moved through the mirror, allowing room for Tarkus to passthrough after, leading him to the outside of this puzzle.
