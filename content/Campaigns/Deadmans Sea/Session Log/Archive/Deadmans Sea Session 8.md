The party continued on with their fight against the [[brown-bear]]s. After the fight, they each took some time to use healing potions and other spells to get into more stable condition. Once healed up, [[Jerok]] continued to scout forward into the [[Draycott Mines]]. He came across a group of [[bandit]]s that were scavenging a central area of the mines. Jerok was able to take out a few of the bandits before anybody knew what was going on and there was a bit of a skirmish between the party and the [[bandit-captain]]s but the bandits lost that fight pretty quickly. The party looted the bandits and checked out the rest of this area. It seems to be a main area where they extract resources from further into the mines. They bring them up to here, sort them and export them through the rest of the cave. Since the party had gone through a couple tough encounters, they decided to fall back into a safer spot in the cave and rest. Late into the morning as the party was finishing up their rest, they came across a crew of [[bugbear]]s and [[kobold]]s who were heading through the tunnel. [[Drithax]] was on watch at this time and was able to get to the frontline and prevent any surprise attacks against the sleeping party members. Once the party was up and fighting they had a blow for blow fight against the bugbears. Many of them taking and dishing out big hits but in the end the bugbears and kobolds died. The party looted what they could off of them and after some investigation realized they all were outfitted with the same weapons, armor, shields, etc. They were all travelling together and seemed to work well together. This lead the party to think they were some type of scouting party or guards or even workers for who/what ever took over the mines. They stand above the mass of dead bodies, blood dripping from their own wounds and thinking of what to do next.
