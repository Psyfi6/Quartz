The players followed the trail of blood back to the original point where they found it. They were able to find the [[Lost Shipment]] of cargo and found that the bodies had been attacked by [[saber-toothed-tiger]]s but the actual wagon was fine. They decided to hop on the wagon and continue on the path back towards [[Bellwater Castle (Tact)]]. After a bit of travel the party decided to stop for the night and rest. During the night, they were ambushed by a group of [[bandit]]s. After a very close encounter, the party was able to finish their rest and search the bodies. they came across a roughly drawn map described as a napkin drawing. [[Rain]] compared it to the map they received from [[ Tact Bellwater]] and noticed it outlined the same cart path. After their rest they continued heading back to the Bellwater castle. Once at the castle, they confronted Tact about what was going on and if he knew anything about the ambush. Tact was very surprised by it . He pulled the party aside into his personal chambers with his 2 main guards that he trusts the most. He thinks someone within his ranks had given the info to someone else to try and recover the cargo before he did. He decided to give the whole party 75 gold each instead of 50 for the successful defense of his cargo. Tact also suggested that if they come back in a few days he would have some more work for them. After their discussion, Tact offered for them to stay the night before leaving since its a new moon and would be very dark and difficult to travel at night. The party decided to stay but was still skeptical about the situation. They decided to take watches over the night but nothing happened. Once they woke up in the morning they were able to enjoy some of the breakfast that was put out onto the table. The party then started to head back into [[Rivermouth]] to talk with [[Serdar Bask]] before going to visit [[Ginvol Steelpike]] at the [[Draycott Mines]]. While on their way back, when trying to cross the river, Rain slipped and fell into the water, the noise and splashing has gotten the attention of some [[crocodile]]s that were laying in the water near by.


- RETCON: 

Tact tells the party about an incoming shipment ([[Intercept Shipment]]) of goods for the town. This includes food/water/clothes/gear. He has asked you to go visit the [[Rivermouth Docks]] in Rivermouth and find one of his ships and tell the workers that you were sent by Tact and that they are to give you a boat to use temporarily. He suggests you may want to pay for some more experiences help to navigate the waters. He also tells you when and where to expect the incoming shipment and that if you can intercept it and bring it to the town your self, you can sell it back to the town at an increased price and split the profit with Tact.
