Â The party boarded the ship carrying the merchant goods and after a bit of back and forth combat, [[Xanriel]] was able to intimidate the other crew to stand down and surrender the goods. While loading up the goods, [[Jerok]] noticed a map that looked similar to the one he had. He was able to combine the 2 together to make a fairly detailed map of what shows other near by islands beside [[Saggeroth]]. Will be useful for some future missions for [[Tact Bellwater]] where they will need to find their way to these other islands for various reasons. After returning to town, they sold the goods to all the merchants in town and got 2k gold from it. While selling the goods, they came across [[Ginvol Steelpike]] who gave [[Kazima]] a [[1-shield|+1 Shield]] engraved with Tact's personal symbol (See: [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Aristocratic Order/Bellwater]]). This was for helping him get his forge back up and running and he was able to make it from some of the spare material he had. The party also noticed that [[Grumm Orcheck]] was still violently ill. They were able to figure out that he might be cursed from the barrel of whiskey they took from the haunted ship ([[Blackwood's Curse]]). [[Murdock]] had heard about some rumors about the "[[Tree of Life]]" and how it has healing powers. After some more research about the topic, they headed up near the [[Shadowfell Tower]] where they came across a [[Ghoul]]. The party made quick work of the ghoul and made sure to haul it along with them to the tree of life. They also were bringing Grumm with them too. Once they arrived at the Tree of Life, they performed the ritual to consume the essence of the ghoul and provide new life to Grumm. Grumm mentioned that he will forever remember what they did for him and that they are always welcome at his tavern ([[Grumm's Keg and Grog]]). Once done with all of that, the party headed to see Tact and split his share of the gold from selling the goods. Tact initially said he would share 10% of the gold but Xanriel convinced Tact that the party deserved more for their accomplishments. The other boat was well equipped and had an experienced crew that was able to nearly get away from them at one point. Tact agreed and gave the party 250 gold of the 2000 and also said they had free access to use his ship when ever they wanted as long as Tact gets a cut of what ever is made.
