# Retconned info
Some of this is filling holes in previous stuff that wasn't fully planned out. Some of this is new expanded info or slight changes to stuff for it to fit the new world.

#### Minor Changes & Info
- The general store in [[Rivermouth]] has now been setup as [[Glimmering Gear]] and is run by a new NPC called [[Tharendel Swiftfoot]]
- The Tavern in [[Rivermouth]] is now called [[Grumm's Keg and Grog]]

- The Stable in town is now called [[Pony's Pavilion]] and is run by [[Mulu Chestroot]]
- The Blacksmith/leatherworker in town is now called [[Starforged Leathers]] and is run by [[Dromac Zumruvo]]
- The +1 Shield given to  [[Kazima]] by [[Ginvol Steelpike]] is engraved with [[Tact Bellwater]]'s personal symbol. See: [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Aristocratic Order/Bellwater]]
- The Whiskey given to [[Grumm Orcheck]] and served at [[Grumm's Keg and Grog]] is now called [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Notable Items/Blackwater Whiskey]] and has some special effects
- [[Bizom Dreamhand]] is no longer considered a god. While he is still an important figure related to the gods he isn't actually a god.

#### Major Changes & Info
- Factions ([[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Faction Relationships]] & [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions Canvas.canvas|Major Factions Canvas]] & [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Faction Details]])
	- Explain some of the larger global info known about the factions. Also some of the local stuff they would have come across. 
- World History and Timeline. [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/History/Historical Events Timeline]]
	- This doesn't really change anything in the current day. Just gives some context to how we got here
- Renown 
	- impact on prices went from 5% per point to 2.5%
	- People, stores, Factions all have renown. These combine for your total. If you piss off a faction and help a store run under that faction it may cancel out.
- Gods ([[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Deities/Deities|Deities]])
	- List of gods who are worshiped or at least believed to be real. None of them walk among the world anymore.
