## Description

	- Roles
		- Sails

				- One turn to reload cannon
				- One turn to aim and shoot cannon

			- spells, bows, etc


## Turn Order
1. Your Boat
	1. Captain gives orders and rolls his 1d6 for turning
		- Orders would be moving people between roles, telling combat people to reload or shoot  
	2. Optional combat 1
		- Combat roles only get to function during one of the 2 combat rounds. Gives you the option to shoot before moving or after moving.
	3. Sails 
	4. Rowers
	5. Optional combat 2
2. Enemy boat
3. Environment


## Role Mechanics
- Sailing:
	- 1d10 per person on sails. captain decides direction to turn sails, sail workers roll for how much the sails get turned. degrees turned = same as combined rolls (7 on roll = 7 degrees)
		- +/- a 1d6 for the captain to help steer. 
- Rowing:
	- strength check per person working oars. distance moved = same as combined rolls (10 on roll = 10 ft)
		- Distance happens after steering so captain can call out to slow down or speed up if angle is good
- Environmental impact
	- Water Movement happens at end of round. d12 for clock direction that water is flowing to. 1d20 for distance pushed.
