Players given quest [[Investigate Shadowfell Tower]]



Mayor [[Serdar Bask]] has gathered everyone at the town center. Serdar explains that the recent attacks outside of town are rumored to be monsters that come from the [[Shadowfell Tower]]. Rumour has it that there was a creature that was created by the gods to look over the land and keep it safe. [[Tact Bellwater]], the royal family in [[Saggeroth]], tried to harness this creatures power for their own needs. They locked it up in the Shadowfell Tower and there is a group who are in charge of keeping the place locked down.

Serdar asks the crowd for a group of volunteers who can go and investigate what is happening at Shadowfell Tower and figure out why there are creatures escaping and attacking innocent people. 

Each of you has volunteered to help. Serdar says you can head to the barracks for gear and then the tavern for a meal and a good nights rest before you leave. He suggests you get to know each other a bit before you head out. (players explain there characters here. Give [[Group Treasure]] handout to players.)

Serdar asks for you to update him on the situation when you return.

- You can use any basic gear for your loadout. No Magic items.   
- You have enough basic supplies to last this trip. You will need to stock up on any other items you feel might be import. 
- Be ready to explain your characters. You can include/exclude what ever you want from your backstory and why you are joining this mission.
