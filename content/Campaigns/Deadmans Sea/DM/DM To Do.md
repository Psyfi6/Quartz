1. Add some life to the world. 
	- loot packages from important encounters
	- some various items that might be found around the town or other areas. paintings, statues, silverware. just to give some life to the scenes and create opportunities to do things outside basic combat and dialog. 
	- maybe some heirlooms that could be stolen/rewarded/found 
	- random people/mobs that the party might come across that has no real narrative impact. I dont want every encounter to be kill everything. Stuff like this gives them some decisions to make and switches up which ones are important or not. 
		- you see a tent and campfire further down the road, you are unsure of what is in front of you, how do you proceed?
2. Character backstory quests and issues
	- Tie in people, objects, areas, related to some of the characters backstories
	- Murdock Grossman
	- He is studying life and death. Maybe have some type of information/quest that is related to the Tree of Life. Some specific material or person who can share info on it or something to help his body? 
3. Tact Quests
	- Intercept shipment. Use a boat to sail off the shore and intercept the cargo ship before it arrives. Steal the cargo and let the ship go. Bring the cargo back into the town to sell with a "recovery fee"
