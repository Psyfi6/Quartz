### Description
[[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Pirate Crews/Blackbeard's Brigade]] is one of the most ruthless crews out there. A core crew for the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/The Shadow Syndicate/Saltwater Scoundrels]] which is a part of [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/The Shadow Syndicate]] who are one of the major factions in the world. The sight of The Bloody Buccaneer is usually an obvious identification for most about the dangers of this crew. Blackbeard who may not be the most physically gifted combatant makes up for it with his menacing intimidation.
