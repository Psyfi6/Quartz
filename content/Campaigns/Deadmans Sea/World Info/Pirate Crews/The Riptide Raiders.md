### Description
	[[The Riptide Raiders]] who are a part of the [[Sea Serpent's Scourge]] are run under captain Redbeard. A younger captain who used to be a part of [[Blackbeard's Brigade]]. Specifically was trained by Blackbeard him self. Redbeard was kicked out of Blackbeard's Brigade due to his overly violent nature, even in comparison to Blackbeard who is similar in nature. People had started calling him Redbeard during his early days as a pirate due to being like a son to Blackbeard at the time and consistently being covered in blood from killing anyone in his way.
