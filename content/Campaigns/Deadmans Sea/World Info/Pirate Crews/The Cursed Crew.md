### Description
[[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Pirate Crews/The Cursed Crew]] is part of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Minor/Black Flag Buccaneers]]. Rumours have it that during a chase one day with a ship trying to take down The Misty Maiden, a huge storm rolled in making it near impossible to navigate the seas. Stories from the crew claim that a flock of ravens surrounded the boat and lead the way to safety. Since this event, their captain was given the nickname of "Raven". She gives off a very dark, mysterious, ominous vibe. There is not much known about her beyond the stories of some sort of mythical or divine intervention which consistently brings safety for her and her crew. While they go by "The Cursed Crew", its not because they feel as though they are cursed. The curse is that destiny has made you cross paths with them.
