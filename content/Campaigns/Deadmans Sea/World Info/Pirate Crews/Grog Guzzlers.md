### Description
[[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Pirate Crews/Grog Guzzlers]] who are a part of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Minor/Black Flag Buccaneers]], are known for their excellent tracking of trade routes and trade ship cargo. They are one of the most successful crews financially. They provide a constant flow of good into the black market. Dirty Dave isn't the scariest or most dangerous pirate but he is still highly respected in [[Oasis]] and by other pirate crews due to the stability he provides to other crews with his economical contributions. He single handedly keeps merchants interested in the goods from pirates. He is also beloved by his crew as they party just as hard as they work and are paid extremely well.
