With the collapse of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]], power of being the rulers of [[Eldoria]] was seen as an open spot by some. Most notably, the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Aristocratic Order]] and the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Commerce Coalition]] have amassed a massive amount of wealth, power, and influence.

## Event Details
Some people are starting to worry that the groups such as [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Aristocratic Order]] and [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Commerce Coalition]] are becoming too powerful and will soon start to rule similar to what the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]] did.
