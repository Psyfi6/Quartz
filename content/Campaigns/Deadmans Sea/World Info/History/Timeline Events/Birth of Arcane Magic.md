## Event Details
Arcane Magic is still in the very early stages. It had been rumored to be a thing for a while now but the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]] kept the information secret because they were worried about what could happen with the use of it. After the collapse of the Lumess kingdom, some of this information become available to the public plus research into it wasn't being prevented anymore. 

It didn't take long to start learning some very basic things about Arcane Magic but those who are able to master the skill the fastest are quickly becoming powerful and potentially dangerous.
