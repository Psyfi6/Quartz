Early on people admired the vision of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]] with the cities they established. They had the respect of everyone plus had systems in place to be the rulers of [[Sunvale]] and at some point all of [[Eldoria]].

## Event Details
Started out as being the visionaries that brought together the city known as [[Sunvale]]. The other tribes who joined together loved how easy their lives were becoming with the help of others in the city. People looked up to them and listened to everything they said. After some time they started creating some official laws and were named Royalty of Sunvale. They had final say in anything that happened in the city. 

When they eventually expanded into other cities they maintained their status as royalty and eventually all of [[Eldoria]] was under their control. As generations went on they would pass on the title of "King" to the first born son. 

Eventually this lead to [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/History/Lumess Royalty/Torvog Lumess]] becoming King. He was not well received by many though as he had very harsh policies and was in general a very abrasive person. People began to despise the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]] which just pissed off Torvog. Because of this, Torvog started to really push various policies that left people with nearly nothing. 

The public decided to band together in a revolution to fight back against the Torvog. The revolution was eventually successful and they were able to kill Torvog as well as many other family members and Royal Soldiers who died in the war. The lack of remaining family members and power lead to them surrendering and giving up control of [[Eldoria]].
