## Event Details
[[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]] was no longer running merchants and taking cuts on everything which make many businesses viable now that they had the extra cash flow. People started up businesses as fast as they could think of them. Merchants travelled from city to city buying and selling goods.
