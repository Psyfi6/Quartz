[[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]] establishes the first type of modern civilization when they start building the city of [[Sunvale]]. 

%%aat-event-end-of-body%%

## Event Details
At this time some people would wander the world looking for food, water, and shelter. Others would live in small tribes that would set up shelter and have hunters who go out to gather resources for the tribe. 

The [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]] came up with the idea of expanding their tribe to include others and create one large tribe. With enough people in the tribe they would be able to have highly skilled people in many different areas of work which would allow them to function better as a whole.
