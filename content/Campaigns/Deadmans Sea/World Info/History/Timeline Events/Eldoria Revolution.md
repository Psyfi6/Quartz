## Event Details
[[Eldoria]] was ruled by the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Lumess Family]]. [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/History/Lumess Royalty/Torvog Lumess]] was the current king at the time of the revolution. The way he was running things was leaving people without money or food or shelter. Eventually it was either fight or die. People grouped up together and formed an army and fought back. Some families had a massive impact on the success of the revolution. Either being able to provide gear or resources in large quantities or the strategists who commanded the fights. These families are now known as the Noble families.
