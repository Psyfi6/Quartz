## DM ONLY INFO
- Bizom's mysterious ring is a ring of wish with 1 out of 3 uses remaining. Would need some high level of identification to figure this out. Done through an NPC at a future time. Anyone trying to identify it would know it is a ring of great power butt they cant seem to fully control or understand it.

RING OF WISH MIGHT BE A DUMB IDEA. MAYBE COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE?
