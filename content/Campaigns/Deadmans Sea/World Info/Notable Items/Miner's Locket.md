Locket found on the body of a dead worker in the [[Draycott Mines]]. Inside is a picture of a younger man and woman. While the body of the dead worker is a bit maimed, you feel like its a picture of him and his wife. 

Due to its condition its probably not worth a whole lot to a merchant. Might hold some significant value to the wife?
