### Personal Notes
- #### Pros
	- Lots of Utility options
	- Fun combat mechanics
	- Melee with a mix of damage and tank
- #### Cons
	- No Spells
	- Close quarters to both teammates and enemies
	- Limited item options
- #### Extra Notes
	- Most of the utility is weaker versions of the existing stuff between fighter/rogue.
	- Rolls split between Strength and Dexterity. Means harder to max out as you level up.
	- Being very close to teammates is required for many abilities which leaves you vulnerable to AOE spells
- #### Stat Priority
	- DEX = STR > CON > INT = WIS = CHA
- #### Quick Draw
	- Requires a one handed weapon and no shield
	- Seems like a fun way to add in guns to the game without the headache of trying to balance it. 
	- Its basically like pulling out a hand crossbow that has a forced sharpshooter on it. 
	- Super short range, harder to hit, but hits hard when it does. Limited used per rest and uses up lots of ability options. 
	- Can create some fun moments without being a constant usage of it. Can feel like a really good turn if you can hit on melee attack + the bonus action quick draw.
