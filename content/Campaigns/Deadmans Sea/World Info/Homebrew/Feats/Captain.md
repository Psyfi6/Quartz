## Description
Gives advantage on one type of charisma check. Either persuasion or intimidation. Fit to the type of leadership that character would have. Do they scare the enemy into submission or do they rally their troops behind them to have a larger force to deal with. Only works against people who would know they are a pirate and what pirates do. Might not work against some city people or tribes.
