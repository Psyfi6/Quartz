## Description
All of the Noble families decided to group together as a show of teamwork for the public. Trying to raise hopes and create a friendlier world. The Aristocratic order is extremely powerful and is considered to run most of the world. 

Internally things aren't how they look to the public. This group is regularly trying to gain an advantage against each other. From sabotaging deals to using spies to gather information about each other. They often work with [[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/The Shadow Syndicate]] for these types of things.
