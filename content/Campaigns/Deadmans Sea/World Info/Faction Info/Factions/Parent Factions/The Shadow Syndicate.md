## Description
Any "shady" task you need done can be done by The Shadow Syndicate. From Pirates on the waters, to thieves in towns and cities, to spies to get info you didn't know existed. A lot of their work is for the [[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Aristocratic Order]], but they still are open to requests from anyone as long as they are willing to pay.
