The once rulers of [[Eldoria]]. They were the first ones to begin establishing modern civilization with the creation of the city [[Sunvale]]. Cities became a huge success and greatly increased the chances of survival and helped improve the general knowledge of its people. This lead to faster advancements and more focused specializations which enabled things such as merchants, workers, builders, soldiers. Although most of the Lumess Family was killed during the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/History/Timeline Events/Eldoria Revolution]].
