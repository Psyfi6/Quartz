## Description
Order of the Divine is a religious group who claims to be able to speak to the Gods. They say that the Gods have certain requests or rules and everyone should be following them. This is the most powerful of the religious groups because it doesn't represent any specific god or subset of gods. Many people believe the things from the Order of the Divine. 


[[Bizom Dreamhand]] is the leader of this group.
