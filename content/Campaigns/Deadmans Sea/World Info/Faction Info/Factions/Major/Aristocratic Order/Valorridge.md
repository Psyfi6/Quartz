## Description
The Valorridge family is a very charismatic and strong group. They were often used as generals, commanders, or leaders. Most of them have been in the ranks of the Wardens of Justice at some point in their lives. The respect these people have earned individually has made them a difficult group of people to say no to. This has allowed them to have important input on many situations.
