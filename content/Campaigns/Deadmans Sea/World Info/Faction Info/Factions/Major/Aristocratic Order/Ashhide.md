## Description
The Ashhide family was a family of skilled leather tanners who provided huge amounts of gear for all things combat related. They made a huge amount of money off of this and have been able to buy their way into control. They are in the pockets of most law enforcement and other government officials.


They own part of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Commerce Coalition/Industrialists]] but are mostly just silent partners.
