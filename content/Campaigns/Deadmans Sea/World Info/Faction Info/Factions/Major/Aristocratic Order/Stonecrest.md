## Description
The Stonecrest family has a unique relationship with the gods. What started out as emphatic worship turned into massive followings. They build massive statues and temples in honor of the gods. This made others more likely to have faith in their gods when they could visualize the otherworldly parts of them. The gods are very pleased by this and are often helping out the Stonecrest family. 


Major influence on the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Minor/Crusaders of the Holy Land]] and part of how they started out.
