## Description
The Steelguard family is a family of blacksmiths who somehow have the ability to forge magical gear. Some say it was a deal with the gods, others say it was some secret arcane magic that was discovered. They create some of the most valuable and sought after gear in the world. Because of this, they are considered to be one of the most important families in the world. 


They own part of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Commerce Coalition/Industrialists]] but are mostly just silent partners. They may occasionally get resources and use some of their workspaces when attempting to craft some magical gear.
