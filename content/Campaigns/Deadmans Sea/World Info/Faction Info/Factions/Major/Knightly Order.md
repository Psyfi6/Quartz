## Description
Mercenaries for hire. This group doesn't really have much management or rules. You ask around pretty much anywhere and you will find people working for the Knightly Order who are willing to help out for a payday. You can find basic workers or fighters to highly skilled people. It all depends on what you are willing to pay. Pretty much every city will have posters up recruiting new people.
