## [[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Parent Factions/Commerce Coalition]]
[[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Commerce Coalition/Merchant Alliance]] is a group of the largest merchants in the world. They joined forces with the [[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Commerce Coalition/Guardians of Fortune]] for protection. With their massive buying power they have a great relationship with the [[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Commerce Coalition/Industrialists]] who will gather resources, manufacture gear or items, and deliver these things directly to the merchants. Together these groups created the Commerce Coalition. Most trade sectors in a large city would be run by the Commerce Coalition. They are incredibly efficient and cost effective because of their size and combined skill sets. They can easily push out other traders from the city.


## [[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Wardens of Justice]]
Local law enforcement will try to deal with a situation first but when things are starting to get out of hand the Wardens of Justice will come in to deal with a situation. Wardens of Justice are highly trained officers and soldiers. They would not typically do day to day work with the local guards and officers. 


## [[Campaigns/Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Knightly Order]]
The largest group of mercenaries and they are willing to do anything for the right price. They work for basically every other faction when needed. They operate under a "don't ask, don't tell" policy. They don't care what you are trying to do or why as long as they get paid. They also have a sliding scale of options to offer. From mercenaries who have just learned how to hold a sword to those with skills you didn't know were possible. They are happy to recruit new people regardless of skill level. Easily to contact. They have signs up in nearly every populated area of the world. 



# Minor Factions
Many of the Minor factions will work together occasionally when needed. A local merchant might hire a local group of mercenaries or be robbed by a local group of thieves. None of these relationships are well known outside of those groups.
