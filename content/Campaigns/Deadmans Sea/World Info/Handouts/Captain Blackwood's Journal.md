Some of the important notes you came across when reading the journal of Captain Blackwood.

- Captain Blackwood explained the mission and part of his job was mapping out their journey because if they do find new land they would set up a new settlement and then eventually have someone go back to the main land. They would then send some more crew including a member of the Bellwater family who would be the owner of this new land. 

- The Bellwater Family are political masterminds. They will take anything given to them and use any advantage they can to pressure others into a deal. He mentions that they lack any moral compass and this is a big reason on why the family has become as powerful as they are. 

- He mentions that a lot of the crew were "Savages". The mission was very dangerous and unlikely to be successful so the pay was extremely high. It was the only way to get a full crew and it brought out a lot of desperate people who had nothing to lose.
