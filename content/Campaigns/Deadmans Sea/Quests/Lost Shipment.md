[[Tact Bellwater]] tells you about a shipment of supplies that were coming from the southeast hills of [[Saggeroth]]. He sent out a team to go collect some materials and resources and bring them back to him. He thinks they should have returned already but hasn't heard anything. He wants you to go check out the situation.
