[[Grumm Orcheck]] tells you about barrel of whisky that is stored on the [[Abandoned Ship]] down the river. The Ship was the first settlers in this area. They were part of the [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Aristocratic Order/Bellwater]] family. They brought a large crew and tons of supplies. Apparently the captain had a barrel of whisky hidden that was planned to be used as a celebration once the crew landed and got setup on a new island. Stories say the captain was murdered so that another crewmate could take control of the ship and "be the hero" when they find land. Some say the original captain haunted the ship and that is why it was abandoned once they got to land. The ship hasnt been touched much since. This is why I think this whisky could still be hidden there. Just watch out for ghosts!
