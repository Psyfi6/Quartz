[[Serdar Bask]] explains that the recent attacks outside of town are rumored to be monsters that come from the [[Shadowfell Tower]]. Rumor has it that there was a creature that was created by the gods to look over the land and keep it safe. [[Tact Bellwater]], the royal family in [[Saggeroth]], tried to harness this creatures power for their own needs. They locked it up in the Shadowfell Tower and there is a group of wizards who are in charge of keeping the place in order.  

Serdar asks the crowd for a group of volunteers who can go and investigate what is happening at Shadowfell Tower and figure out why there are creatures escaping and attacking innocent people. 

Serdar asks for you to update him on the situation when you return.
