[[Grumm Orcheck]] will become sick due to getting cursed from opening up the barrel of [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Notable Items/Blackwater Whiskey]]. He will continue to get worse and worse but Murdock or maybe someone else from the party can suggest a rumor they have heard about the [[Tree of Life]]. The party will be given the quest to bring Grumm to the Tree of Life to try and cure him of the curse.

They will need to try and learn what is needed to have a successful ritual.


Only available if the party completes the quest to bring the [[Forgotten Whisky]] back to Grumm Orcheck
