Life has been restored back to normal on [[Saggeroth]]. Your party has become competent adventurers. Your team feels like there isn't much left for them in Saggeroth and they want to go out and explore more of the world.Â 

Find a way to leave Saggeroth and go to the mainland or find new islands

Teleport, fly, buy a boat, steal a boat, build a boat

Quest can be given by either [[Tact Bellwater]] or [[Serdar Bask]]. Or the player can even come up with the idea.
