[[Tact Bellwater]] Tells you about an incoming shipment of supplies for [[Rivermouth]]. He suggests going to the [[Rivermouth Docks]] and find his workers there and they will take them out to sea to try to intercept this incoming shipment. He says if you are successful that you should then bring the shipment back to town and sell it to the merchants there and charge an extra fee. Then come back to him after this is done and he will give you a cut of the money you make form this.
