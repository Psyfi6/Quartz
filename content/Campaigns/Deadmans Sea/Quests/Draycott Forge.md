[[Ginvol Steelpike]] tells you that they used to use the [[Draycott Mines]] to harvest resources and create equipment. They have a forge and other tools setup at the base inside the mines. They are normally equipped with gear because they occasionally have to fight off evil creatures. For some reason lately there has been an abnormal amount of attacks. They have had to abandon their position within the mine for now.Â 

He asks for your help clearing out a path back to their base inside the mine.

Reward: Takes a request from each person in the party for a simple magical piece of gear. (+1 weapon/armor/shields). Randomly selects one of them to make.


The gear is engraved with [[Tact Bellwater]]'s personal symbol. See [[Deadmans Sea/World Info/Faction Info/Factions/Major/Aristocratic Order/Bellwater]]
