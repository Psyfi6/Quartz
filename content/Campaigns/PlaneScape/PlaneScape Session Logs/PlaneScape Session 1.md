Pete caught up to us in the hallway. As Pete got to us we had someone open up one of the other doors beside us and begin questioning us about what we were doing here. After a quick few words back and forth things ended up in a fight. Pinto went down as she was focused for being the one to talk back to the guy questioning us. M.J. was able to get Pinto back up. There was another door that opened up that had some Poltergeists and Skeletons that came out and started attacking us after we had causes some commotion in the hallway. 

We were able to take care of the skeletons but its been difficult to deal with the invisible poltergeists. M.J. was able to cast Turn Undead which helped keep the poltergeists away from us. 

During the fight, Q took a hit from the flesh golem. Q tried to block the slam but wasn't strong enough to counter it. The damage seemed to deform his arm almost as if it was dislocated. Alindor was the only one to notice that when Q healed up after the hit, his body seemed to be partially soft and form back together leaving nearly no trace of the prior damage.

After we took down the flesh golem, Pinto was able to find a key lodged inside of the flesh golem. 

After searching around we found a potion of poison resistance, 30 gold pieces, 3 various outfits hung up (Society of Sensation is one of the 3).
