We search around a bit more. 


We came across a large fridge type room, and while investigating it, we heard some thuds, and after checking it out more it turns out there was a guy sleeping in one of the containers. After we saved him he mentioned he was on his first day of the job and was thinking it might be a good place for a nap. He was lucky we came by and were able to save him before he froze to death. We asked him where the exit was and he was able to lead us towards the stairway out of here. Once he showed us the exit we left the mortuary and as we got on the street we had some lady come up and yell at us. We weren't really sure what was going on but Alindor smacked this lady to try and calm her down.
