Class B
Fighter - Champion

Both are offence powerhouse classes. Fighter is more focused on the Crits, while Paladin is more focused on divine smites and additional utility to help pump out damage.

5th level paladin with 3nd level fighter (8 total) would let me attack 4 times on a turn (Action Surge) and each of those attacks would have crit of 19-20 (Champion) plus advantage if Vow Enmity (Channel Divinity) is used. This would be a 19% crit chance on a typical attack or 53% chance that one of my attacks that turn is a crit. Adding in divine smites as needed.
