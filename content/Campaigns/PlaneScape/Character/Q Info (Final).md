## Intro
- Q (short for qubit), is a robotic warforged construct. He was created by The Quotient. He is a prototype quantum machine built to travel the multiverse and enforce order. He is a mix of AI that learns from its surroundings, a Quantum Drive that manages configuration and communication across the multiverse, and a swarm of nanobots that form together to create his functional body.



### Quantum Drive
- Q's Quantum Drive is entangled with the Ion Matrix at the lab where Q was created. The Quotient can manipulate the Ion Matrix to modify its state. During the next Sentry's Rest that Q takes, it will engage Q in this new state. Although due to some Planar Interference, the disruptions in the connection can cause the Quantum Drive to enter states unpredictably.
- Lingering Programming: Despite the glitch, you might still experience flashes of your original programming, urges to enforce order, or even receive fragmented messages from The Quotient.


### Ion Matrix States

| Dice Value | Quantum State | Result                            | Links                          |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1          | 00            | No Change                         |                                |
| 2          | 01            | Paladin                           | [[Q - 01 (Paladin) - Leveling]]           |
| 3          | 10            | Fighter                           | [[Q - 10 (Fighter) - Leveling]]           |
| 4          | 11            | MultiClass of Paladin and Fighter | [[Q - 11 (Paladin & Fighter) - Leveling]] |


### Nanobots Reconfiguration
- Q's body is configured by a swarm of nanobots. During Sentry's Rest, the nanobots will reconfigure to "repair" any major deformations. During this reconfiguration, the nanobots will attempt to create an appearance that mimics the things from Q's surroundings since the last rest. During brief period of this reconfiguration, Q's body is malleable.



### Evolving Self
- Prime Directive: The Quotient programmed you with a core directive to eliminate chaos and enforce order.
- Moral Autonomy: Free from The Quotient's direct control, you are forced to make your own choices about how to use your abilities and what constitutes order.
- Moral Exploration: With each new loadout and experience, you become more self-aware. You'll grapple with questions of right and wrong, good and evil, and the true meaning of order in a chaotic multiverse.
- Appearance: Q will always look a bit robotic as the nanobots that make up his body will never have "skin". He may display specific attributes such as elf ears, but when inspected still appear robotic in nature. During Sentry's Rest, Q will undergo his Nanobot Reconfiguration which will alter his appearance.
- Personality: Q has some preconfigured concepts and ideas around what order means and how to achieve it. Although The Quotient wanted him to learn from those around him to help understand regional and cultural differences and consider how those things may impact bringing order to chaos.



### Major Deformation (Fatality)
- If Q suffers from major damage that causes enough of his nanobots to be dislodged from each other, he becomes unresponsive as his nanobots go into survival mode. During this mode, they do not register any information other than simply signaling to each other in an attempt to regroup and reconfigure with the Quantum Drive. 
- After the nanobots successfully regroup and reconfigure, Q will eventually "reboot". Things learned previously will be corrupted and unable to be accessed. This causes Q to fall back to his default programming, appearance, personality. 



#### Notes

Session 0 questions:
- Question 3: What is your characterâ€™s signature possession or physical trait? What makes you certain that your character would retain this no matter what could have happened in their life?
	- Q's Quantum Drive is his Signature possession. It essentially is Q. The nanobots and everything else around him are just parts of the functional robot body.





### Todo:
- Create Token
- Settle on Splash art
- Sort out background and other info needed to finalize character creation
- Character Creation
	- Dice Rolls
		- Actual Rolls
			- 18, 16, 14, 13, 13, 9 (83) - fighter (+2 str, +1 con)
			- 17, 17, 15, 13, 12, 11 (85) - multi
			- 17, 14, 13, 12, 12, 12 (80) - pal (+2 str, +1 con) (could do +1 cha and then +1 twice str,cha on this character from the extra jason gave?)
		- +3 to each set for race/background. +2, +1 OR +1, +1, +1
		- Additionally Jason is giving us +3 to spend somewhere
	- Starting feat
- 250g to spend to start




- Update "Planar Infusion" background? 
	- Should be something related to Quotient HQ or something?
