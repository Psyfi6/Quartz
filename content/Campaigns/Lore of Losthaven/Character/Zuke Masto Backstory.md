## Actions
***Glaive Main Attack.*** +6 to hit. 1d10+4 slashing damage.

***Glaive Polearm Master Attack.*** +6 to hit. 1d4+4 bludgeoning damage.

## Traits
***Polearm Master.*** You can keep your enemies at bay with reach weapons. You gain the following benefits:
When you take the Attack action and attack with only a glaive, halberd, or quarterstaff, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary weapon. The weapon’s damage die for this attack is a d4, and the attack deals bludgeoning damage.
While you are wielding a glaive, halberd, pike, or quarterstaff, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter the reach you have with that weapon.

***Second Wind.*** You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

***Watcher's Eye.*** Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you’re more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.

***Fighting Style: Great Weapon Mastery.*** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

- Where are you from? 
	- Lasthaven (city)
- Who is your family? 
	- Father: Stollus Masto (stole-us)
	- Mother: Dilina Masto (dill-eee-nuh)
	- Younger Sister: Naldrina Masto
- What was your childhood like? 
	- Good parents who taught me how to be a good person. My mom stayed at home and took care of me while my dad went to work. When he would come home he would teach me stuff he learned at work.
- What were you doing before you became an adventurer?
	- Mostly just growing up. My parents always pushed to be a good citizen, and get a good education so i can help make a difference in the world. I was still studying before i decided to join the city watch.
- What has pushed your character to want to be an adventurer?
	- My mother, Dilina Masto was robbed by thieves, felt like i had the skills to be part of the city watch and help protect. A call for help felt like my duty to serve as well as an easy/simple way to put my skills to the test. 
- What drew you to your class? 
	- The training from my father who is a soldier. He trained me on hand to hand combat and simple/martial weapons which naturally drew me to be a fighter. 
- What projects/hobbies that your character partakes in?
	- research/learning/studying, training my combat skills, participating in events around my city
- What are you afraid of? 
	- Losing members of my family, life turning into chaos with the law enforcement either not being present or not being respected. Having wasted my life not making the impact i believe i can. 
- What motivates you?
	- Making a positive impact on the lives of the people around me. Improving my self to be a better person than i was yesterday. Helping someone in need. 
- What are your vices?
	- Attempting to earn the respect of others or doing what's needed of me even if its dangerous or detrimental to my self. I sometimes find my self pushing too hard to get something done fast where i may not be fully prepared or end up burning out due to lack of rest.
- Does your character have value in the gods?
	- Platinum Dragon is the ultimate example of the way someone should live their life. When making a tough decision, its good to think about what the Platinum Dragon would do in that situation.
- Is there a specific that your character could curry favor from or has a preference to?
	- if needed, i could likely name drop my father to The Prime Swarm in an attempt to instantly gain their respect and have them help us. 
	- One day i would love to follow in the foot steps of my father and join The Prime Swarm my self.
- What are your thoughts on the Kingdom of Lynweer as a whole?
	- Its important to respect the monarch. They are the reason we have the life we have today. From settlements to protection to the laws we follow. Without them who knows what life could look like. If you treat the monarch well, they will treat you well. It is a honor to serve a higher cause.
- What are your thoughts on the crown?
	- Same as above
- Who would your “I know a Guy” NPC be?
	- My father, Stollus Masto. Extremely skilled in combat, knows his stuff, confident and holds the attention and respect of everyone in the room when he walks in.


Backstory: 
While growing up, my father, Stollus Masto, was part of The Prime Swarm. He was out posted in Lasthaven (city) since i was born.  He would come home after work and spend time teaching me some of the things he learned. I was able to become very good at 1 on 1 combat. My parents always made sure i was learning new things or studying. They also taught me how to be a good person and follow the ideologies of the Platinum Drago. Such as respecting the law, caring for others. After The Prime Swarm was mostly recalled by the monarch, things started to get out of control and my mother was robbed on the streets one day while walking home from some shopping. I felt as though my skills could be used in the city watch to help keep things under control in Lasthaven (city) and prevent something like this from happening again. If i couldn't help protect the whole city at least i should be able to help protect my mother (Dilina Masto) and sister (Naldrina Masto). I hope one day to prove my self and be able to join The Prime Swarm and follow in the footsteps of my dad. Seeing this poster asking for help is just one way i can take action and turn the world into a better place while also getting some real experience that can hopefully get the attention of my superiors and/or the local Prime Swarm members. Earning the respect of the people within the city is also an important matter. Some people are losing faith in our law enforcement with the way things are going and maybe i can help restore some of that faith.
