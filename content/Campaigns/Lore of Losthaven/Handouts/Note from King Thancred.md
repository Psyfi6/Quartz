I hope this missive finds you well. Word of your exploits and service have reached past the Crimson Coast, along the Altar’s Strait, and onto Stormbreaker’s wharf to my Landing. I must commend a job well done at dispensing of my justice and acting on the crown’s behalf. Whilst my son would have loved to have heard of your deeds, it gladdens my heart to hear that there are those that would take up the mantle as agents of my realm. 

It is my son and the circumstances of his demise that I have asked Captain Ashmantle to deliver this request. I have received word that Lady Samyra has awoken from her slumber. As the lone survivor in the confrontation of the Iced Dread and the decimation of Stillgarde, Lady Samyra holds information that no others have. As the Warden of the Laws of Gods and Men and a grieving father, I must know what happened to the city and to my son.

I ask that your party travel to the Dorlin Peaks and to the Monastery of the Unspoken Whisper to get Lady Samyra’s account. Once Captain Ashmantle has sent this report, I must instruct another task of you… 

Go to the Obsidian Graves to survey the damage and recover my son’s remains so that his mother and I can put his soul to rest within the crypts of his home. I do not forget that you have not sworn the crown’s oath of service and I am not so foolish as to assume you will do this due to the kindness of your hearts. I will not pretend to appeal to your honor. From the reports I have received, there is a tunnel leading to the Iced Dread’s lair and thus his horde. The only treasure I look to have restored to me is my son. You may keep what you can carry without crown taxes being applied. 

Upon the recovery of Prince Zaldin’s body, please accompany this precious cargo on the Kraken’s Taint to Lynweer Landing to relay your discoveries in person and to gain anointment and recognition for your service to the Crown. 

Eagerly awaiting your audience, 

King Thancred Aristole Maximus of Lynweer; Third of His Name; The Seated; The Proud; Protector of the realm and warden of the laws of Gods and Men.
