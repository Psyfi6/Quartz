Almeris looked around the various cells and found 2 different cells with symbols of The Clasp carves into the walls. We checked into the zone of truth sigils to see if we could understand them. They seemed like you could possibly remove it and relocate it to use it but it would be difficult to get one out without getting noticed. Tal and Varenian started talking to a random guard asking him what he thought about his boss (Captain Braddock Humes) and then explaining that we think their boss may be related to the incident we are investigating. That guard went to get his supervisor (not the guy we think is guilty), This was Granger Sharpe. We discussed what was going on and Granger suggested we go into another room and discuss this in private. During our discussion with Granger, Tal mentioned that the captain had been involved in some genocide in the past. (Greg 17 insight, Zuke 9 insight, Tal 25 persuasion). Tal convinced everyone that its very likely that the captain was involved in some shady stuff in the past but nobody really knows how it relates to Tal.

Zuke rolled a 21 on history to see what he remembered about the Captain. It was mostly just stories from my dad and not that i actually remember him being around as a kid and that i would know his personality or any stories that are meaningful to this accusation.

Tal begins to tell Granger about the story with the captain. Mentions that a group of people, including the captain, came in and slaughter a whole village of dragonborns. He mentions that he found the sigil of The Prime Swarm. Varenian noticed that this was likely Tal's family but Zuke did not quite pick up on that. Granger asks us to stay put and says he will be right back. We can all kind of tell the sort of excitement he has as if hes finally got the evidence he needs to take down the captain. 

As we listen to what is going on, we hear captain screaming and eventually the sound of swords being drawn and us plus a number of guards enter into the room. While we do that, we see a a large spider like creature climb out and it has a drow as its upper body (drider). 

We enter into combat and a few of the guards try to help out but they are quickly taken down. After a few great rounds of attacks we were able to take down the Drider. We then turn our attention to the captain and take him down. As he is collapsing to the ground, Tal grabs him and stares into his eyes. Tal feels some kind of magical force grasping onto him tightly during this interaction but nothing much comes from it. 

Tal then drags the body of the captain into the fireplace in the other room. Granger suggests that we could go and ask prisoners more questions if we wanted. Granger was going to spend some time cleaning up this room and sorting things out. 



Next session: 
- Zuke wants to try and figure out more about The Prime Swarm and what my dad may have been involved in. Wants to try to avoid conflict with Tal and avoid bringing up this stuff in front of him. 
	- Need to understand more about if this was a typical mission for The Prime Swarm or if it was more of a one off thing. Maybe Tal's village was dangerous or something, maybe the soldiers were just following orders. Zuke likely wants to try and deny wrong doing of his dad as he seems him in a positive light. The last few (months?) have been a pretty big shock to what the real world is like and its possible that Zuke could have a lot of his beliefs changes based on information related to these events.
- Zuke (and maybe others) wondering why these other suspects are not being released after all of this
- Zuke wondering WTF he just witnessed with the magical flames and shadows and what ever else going on with the captain



# UPDATE
This was actually our "final" session of Lore of Losthaven. Em was too busy with work and other things to keep up with running this game. We may resume at some point but its on hold for now.
