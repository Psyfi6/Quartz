Meat with captain of city guard, they explained what they wanted from us. Gave us some resources such as health potions, spell scrolls, pets, gear, etc. After gearing up and getting ready we left to go find the bandit camp. We came across the group and killed most of them but kept a few alive.

We turned the bodies in, got the blue tooth phone from the captain of the city watch and headed out to the bandit camp. On our way there we came across the dead bandit body and the fey whistle. We phoned into the captain near the end of the day to give him an update. He asked us to bring it in when we get back. We ended up camping out at the same camp as last time where we moved some of the bodies away from camp. During the night we came across a single panther while on watch. We also found a note with the following names "Romilia, Valeria, Apion, Osma, Iraugui, Barca, and Circassi". These are names of the founding members of the city of lasthaven.
