We started off the session at our camp trying to deal with a bunch of wolves that attacked while we were resting. We dealt with them pretty quickly and then finished our rest. We continued forward in the morning until we ended up hearing some laughing/giggling coming from the bushes around us. We were ambushed by a bunch of hyenas and Gnolls. It was a very bloody battle but we were able to deal with most of them. We finish off the session still deep into combat.
