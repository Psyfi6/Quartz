Almeris was handed an item from Fen in our previous session. After Almeris looked into the item some more he came across a rolled up paper that was basically a "business card" for The Clasp. Its a good item for him to have on him in case he needs to distinguish him self for some specific people. Almeris kept this info to him self. 

We went to the city watch in the and asked them to talk to some of the people they had in custody. They were pretty reluctant to allow us to enter or to talk to the prisoners. But we displayed our letters that had showed us being tasked to deal with the situation and decided to finally let us ask what we wanted. (Talking with Captain Braddock Hughmes).

Braddock asked Zuke to stick around and chat for a second. He mentioned that Zuke looked familiar. After a bit of conversation it becomes clear that he's worked with Zuke's Dad in the past. He mentioned that if I was looking to move up the ranks to let him know and he might have some stuff for me to do.

After some more investigation and questions we realized that each prison cell is basically a permanent zone of truth. We realized after talking with some of the prisoners and none of them seemed to be suspects and that maybe the captain of the watch here is maybe hiding some info.
