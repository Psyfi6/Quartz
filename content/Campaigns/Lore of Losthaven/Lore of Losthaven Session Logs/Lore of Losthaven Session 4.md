First day of travel went okay but while camping out at night we came across a group of panthers. We were able to deal with them without any major injuries. We completed our long rest and then continued the next morning. As we get deeper into the woods we notice a tree that seems to be moving as we approach it. They tried to approach us and it was a dangerous fight but we were able to make it through. We took a short rest to heal up and then continued on through the day. the rest of the day was uneventful. We set up camp again. Very early into the night we were ambushed by a large group of wolves.
