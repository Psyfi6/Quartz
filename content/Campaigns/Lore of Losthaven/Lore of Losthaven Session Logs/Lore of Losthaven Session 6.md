We start the session time skipped ahead as if we finished the combat that was a continuation from session 5. This was also enough to level us up to level 3. 

We made it to Summitcrest and did a bit of exploring of the town and shopping. After shopping we headed to Meatpie Maggies. While in there, we noticed a few customers storm out of the building after a discussion with one of the staff. The next morning, we saw a fight on the street between those same people from the night before. Town guards eventually broke up the fight but we heard one of them yell out about the other being responsible for killing someone. We discussed with the staff of Meatpie Magies about this. We went to investigate the dead body to see if we could figure out what happened. We noticed the usage of magic as part of the cause of death. We plan to discuss with Fen to see if he knows anything and then maybe go to the bar and ask around there.
