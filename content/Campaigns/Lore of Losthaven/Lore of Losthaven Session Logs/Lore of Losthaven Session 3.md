Captain asked us to give suggestions on what to do with the captured bandits. We decided they should be sent to the monastery to be rehabilitated. ([[Bandits]])

We received a letter from king Thancred asking us to go to the Obsidian Graves. ([[Note from King Thancred]])

We found out more about some of the people we are interacting with. ([[Family info]])
